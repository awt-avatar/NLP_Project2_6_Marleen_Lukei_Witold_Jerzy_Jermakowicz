i would like to commend the efforts at unity made by the various political groups in parliament which have allowed the home of european democracy to speak with one voice and emphasised the strong pragmatic bent of this resolution which suggests ways solutions and specific measures for the eu to deal with the iranian regime

the present rules of competition are inadequate
apart from casting doubt on democratic control such an arrangement would lengthen the reporting period and jeopardize the recently restored coordination of the work of stoa with that of the committees

we must i think negotiate with putin but that does not mean that we have to dine with him like mates together
just to get the measure approved at the second reading the internal market and consumer protection committee has agreed to a text which does not satisfy us because it does not provide for origin marking
further action must therefore be taken here because this makes it difficult to establish common prerequisites and the performance indicators proposed by the rapporteur
we are not to be pushed around by putin
in addition to designing and building safer vehicles member states should also invest in the safety of road infrastructure
the issue of the common energy policy should be solved by bringing it to the european community level

thirdly the report notes and rightly so that too little attention has been paid to social aspects in the lisbon strategy
the principal changes we have made are as follows firstly the replacement of the term provocation with the term incitement which is more precise and is used more frequently in legal language secondly a stricter definition of public incitement which more clearly delineates the behaviour to be criminalised and therefore prevents any abuses that would lead to the restriction of freedom of expression thirdly the incorporation into the text of many provisions relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and in particular freedom of expression and freedom of the press fourthly a reminder of the need to guarantee that the measures taken are proportionate to the aims pursued which is essential in a democratic nondiscriminatory society

mr president even those of us who have been lucky enough to have been to north korea more than once find it hard to understand what that regime wants and where it is going
we therefore need to go further and to give thought to the idea of introducing an international currency or at the very least of creating a common political system bringing together a few main currencies
that is why we do not need new rounds on liberalisation instead we need a fundamental analysis and evaluation of the effects of the uruguay round on countries people and the environment
it is unfortunate that the president did not take the trouble to be here today

the treaty of lisbon grants the eu new prerogatives confirms the development of its international capacity and puts new tools in place

mr president commissioner in relation to what mrs haug had to present a banker might say that the budget for the other institutions is peanuts small budgets which are not as significant including from the political standpoint but which are important nonetheless because they allow the other institutions to make their work transparent and thus i think to look their citizens in the eye
what lessons do we need to learn from the developments over the last two years from the financial and economic crisis and now from the currency crisis
we therefore expect that this will be taken into consideration for the member states in the corresponding column
this wise saying must not be misunderstood it counsels stubborn determination rather than inactivity and it is when as sometimes happens we begin to become resigned to the persistence with which the same human rights issues resurface over and over again that we must continue to speak out with tenacity and a clear voice we must be unrelenting in the defence of human rights whether this be in the face of the chinese government or of other regimes that trample these rights underfoot
it is even a threat to driver safety
it is noteworthy that it comes to us via the route of the committee on petitions and it is to the credit of that committee that it manages to bring together opinions from across the spectrum of this house through hearings and this report to try to get a synthesised view

mr president ladies and gentlemen i rise to ask if the council has already considered including the galileo satellite navigation project in the odysseus programme and to what extent plans for this have progressed
however i am convinced that the ministers for justice will not let things get so far that ultimately the heads of government will have to solve a technical problem which is predominantly concerned with modality

partly because of the lack of response from the united states on afghanistan the union has a particularly important role to play and we must be ready to play it

daytoday practice and i include my own country in this indicates that there are still plenty of loopholes that definitions are unclear that prohibitions are sometimes ignored and that commercial considerations all too often take precedence over respect for human rights
the court has spoken clearly on the subject
his publications are testimony to an academic profile that is undoubtedly on a level with the tasks he has to carry out and his experience in the monetary field must cast aside any doubts about his abilities

from this point of view i regret the fact that our parliament has not been able in conjunction with the council of going further in defining the size of the market and that we allowed on this issue too a key point in negotiation and which provided balance in the text to be left to our experts and for the next stage of the regulatory process

as an actress that is nothing new to me
mr president mr presidentinoffice of the council commissioners ladies and gentlemen it has been said in this house a number of times and it is not unimportant there is wide unanimity across the political divide on this issue and you must support it in the forthcoming negotiations in bonn

why a compromise
i agree with those who say we have a strict policy in place but that we cannot emerge from the crisis with that alone
if this is not the case if we were to confuse social policy with structural policy we would reach a conclusion which i wish to avoid in future debates and in debates on forthcoming financial developments and it is this that appraisals of unemployment concentrating on major towns and cities on major towns and cities in prosperous countries are capable of attracting the greater part of investment in structural funds
that situation is clearly unsatisfactory and i intend to investigate it further and include it in my report

commissioner patten is absolutely right to say that the european union has got its act together to a considerable extent in the balkans
those countries that have created a number jobs have also created genuine deregulation of the product market
mr president i suspect that there was a plot in this house in scheduling this debate right now because it was expected that this would be the time at which england would have been playing against france

this approach must remain complementary to and distinct from the other policies targeting smes and industry

mr president i voted with my partys whip on this particular report and against many of the amendments

mr president presidentinoffice of the council commissioners i would first of all like to express my thanks for the words of our authority figures regarding maintaining an optimistic stance in the face of the crisis that we are experiencing

the council acknowledges the importance of transparency in eu business
this is why we also need to devote a great deal of attention in international negotiations to the continuing development and use of technologies which enable fossil fuels to be used efficiently without emitting greenhouse gases

that is absolutely clear
this would mean that the meps from the new member states could play a part in approving the commissioners from their countries
there can be no dispute that the presidential elections in zimbabwe were illegitimate and the violence murders arrests and harassment of the opposition within the country are a particularly savage aspect of the absence of justice

the subject of production costs does not appear either in the regulations on rural development or in the regulations on consumer policy there is not even the barest mention
madam president commissioner ladies and gentlemen it is of course completely normal in the european parliament to begin by thanking our fellow members but in the case of this directive i believe that it is actually appropriate to start with this expression of thanks

they must be able to do their work their businesses must be profitable and their services competitive and they must not be bogged down by unnecessary redtape and legislation
let us say it frankly and freely the ecsc was the first concrete cooperation in europe between partners who had fought bloody wars against each other three times in the sixty years before
similarly previous experience of enlargement in europe and studies into the phenomenon of immigration suggest that young migrant workers from the new member states will tend to migrate towards the wealthier areas of their own countries to large towns where unemployment rates are relatively lower and there are relatively good prospects of finding work
twenty years under saddam hussein left five million iraqis suffering from chronic poverty the fastest increase in child mortality of any country in the world access to safe water for less than half the people in rural areas and wholly dependent on food handouts
that is the aim of the directive

the presidency of the council which has been aware of this situation has contacted all the member states of the union to urge them to push forward and speed up their ratification procedures and nothing would give us greater satisfaction than to be able to say that by the end of our presidency the cotonou agreement had been ratified we must bear in mind that this agreement will come into force on the first day of the second month following the date on which the ratification instruments are deposited by the european union member states and two thirds ie of the acp states as well as the instrument by which the community approves the agreement
the law has not kept up with the development of digital communications so a new legal framework needs to be created which makes it possible to regulate a changing reality

a degree of mutual trust is therefore required between member states concerning their judicial procedures

i already have one for it

that would mean however that we would be completely unable to provide primary and secondary prevention of certain diseases or the urgently necessary protection against the risks of disease occasioned by globalisation
it is time for reforms imagination and integration

this is why we cannot allow the appointment of pinochet to chiles senate due on the of next month and subject to protest by all the main political parties in chile to pass without international protest from ourselves
the monitoring mechanism that we adopted in its improved form a year ago is yielding results
constructive thinking and flexibility are needed for this not only on the part of croatia but of course on the part of its partners as well

we want the establishment of a coordinating centre for the monitoring of industrial change as a contribution to a more proactive approach to the management of medium and longerterm industrial change in terms of its impact within the european union and i would draw mr chichesters attention to the fact that service industries too are industries and we are looking at industrial change overall

the treaty of amsterdam established for the first time the union s competence in the field of immigration and asylum and the tampere european council agreed that the issues of asylum and immigration which are different but closely related make a european union common policy necessary this means that we need to evaluate present and future migratory flows in all their categories humanitarian reasons family reunification and economic reasons as the rapporteur already mentioned and demographic changes the situation of the labour market and of the immigrants countries of origin
this process was accelerated by many german chemical weapons submerged here at the end of world war ii including bombs and canon balls with dioxin mustard gas and other souvenirs which are starting to pose hazards after years of corrosion

madam president the council of ministers is currently holding discussions with iran on a number of issues including salman rushdie
presidentinoffice in answering this question i will focus on the energy aspects because that is how we understood the question
on the other hand i hope that adopting this instrument will mean that the european union institutions will no longer have any reason to postpone the work on the vis and sis legislative package as adoption of the latter is very much in the interests of the new member states
i am pleased that we have succeeded in introducing a joint resolution supported by almost all the groups because it is important to express our opposition to the legislation and to support lesbians gay men and transgender people in uganda
germany wants to see the constitution doctored
therefore the constitution project has not failed

the proposed directive on designs and models was the subject of a common position adopted unanimously by the council
this has to rest on quality information
anyone who votes in favour of mr gauzess proposal will be ensuring that the commission does what it wants to do anyway namely proposes no financial transaction tax
the structure and main provisions of the programme represent an excellent response by the union to the recommendations made in the kok and marimon reports and to the european parliaments proposals contained in the locatelli report
we do not support either one of them the real reply lies in the defence of national identities
the vote will take place on wednesday may
even at a lower price hardly any specialist books would be sold
we are closely monitoring this issue all the time but i cannot comment on particular investigations that are now ongoing or are being developed

i fully subscribe to this approach
in addition in order to improve the presentation and availability of information to the public to specialised audiences and to patients the commission is at an advanced stage of preparing an eu public health portal drawing together information at eu level national and regional levels and with resources from civil society
i also hope that this will obtain a majority in the house tomorrow
because of all this i ask the commissioner to explain to me the reasoning behind this proposal
yet you are checked onto the aircraft you have to have a boarding pass with your name on it and the airline is responsible for checking that the name on the pass is yours
if one thing is certain it is that beijing has found a new ally in its harassment of the tibetan people and that new ally is nepal

improvements are desperately needed in some areas
therefore together with the commissioner responsible for education and the commissioner responsible for research we are going to draw up a roadmap to improve the involvement of women both in science training and in research
i am referring to sexual abuse physical violence within the family enforced prostitution forced marriage and female circumcision
the measure sought both to increase agricultural production in those countries where the effects of rising prices are felt most strongly jeopardising chances of meeting the millennium development objectives and as far as possible to avoid instability and tensions that might endanger the results of years of investment in the political spheres of development and peacekeeping
amendments were adopted however which attempted to underline the fact that stricter national measures are allowed under single market measures provided they are proportionate nondiscriminatory and not purely economic in nature
we want to involve local and regional stakeholders more actively by means of pilot projects and therefore call on the commission to top up the funding it has proposed
my question was whether the flexibility of million and applies to all the categories of the budget including category
europeans share a love of watching and participating in football from newcastle through dortmund to barcelona but it is important that local people should be inspired to join their clubs
i therefore welcome it wholeheartedly
at the same time however as studies have shown they want new social relations and new forms of intervention
however these two events give us more opportunity to conduct an even more intense dialogue and to achieve tangible results in discussions with our partners from the peoples republic of china both in regard to ecology and human rights
that is why we must make europe more efficient more democratic
there is an urgent need to return to a comprehensive peace process with a clear political perspective
when the eu decided to start accession negotiations it was done in the hope and expectation that turkey does indeed have a place in the european family
my group strongly supports it but demands and i shall continue to demand that it is implemented in the context of the community method under the auspices of the commission mr president
i am determined to ensure that replies are fully consistent with one another so that dialogue becomes increasingly clear and accurate
the danube runs through seven european capitals and nearby many urban agglomerations that is why the safety of the transport of dangerous goods along danube is extremely important
its independence in political economic financial organisational and staffing terms is guaranteed and is not challenged by the draft treaty establishing a constitution for europe
the trigger for this report for which i am very grateful to mrs svensson was in this case not only the fact that it was noticed in the context of the report on equality that equality is also put at serious risk as a result of violence against women but also the fact that through the treaty of lisbon we now have the opportunity to enact a directive and to establish a common legal framework in europe
mr president belarus is in focus now not only for sharing over one thousand kilometres of border with the eu but also as the last surviving major european bastion of neosoviet ideology
it is a very complex issue and i would like to thank you particularly for being so consistently transparent throughout these negotiations and for making it possible for us to look at the project from a holistic perspective
i count on the support of all governments and parliaments that still need to complete their procedures to ratify the accession treaty
madam president i should like to begin by offering the rapporteur mr desama my warmest thanks
this mr president is certain the message of the anthem of madeira has been mentioned here but i have also drawn a lesson from the anthem of portugal which proclaims heroes of the sea noble people brave nation
you must not believe that there has been any manoeuvring by anyone
in this case the member states must do everything to try and help these refugees to leave that territory and we think that they could be accepted in european states
i mention this so that we may take advantage of the potential of such umbrella organisations and cooperate more with them
i think that this is how things stand now and at present after the barcelona summit and johannesburg in which the issue of the environment was not sufficiently dealt with i would not ask for the ambitious programme that too many people are asking for here
it seems to me that many other states are promoting their interests very aggressively
tenth is the kurdish question which has sadly become a particularly topical issue over the last few days
madam president what we are concerned with here is prioritising eu expenditure
i am more committed than ever to advancing further this very important dimension of our european agenda for culture
however the causes of these financial aberrations are not the causes identified by the rapporteur
the fact is that there is in the region itself nothing left of the loudlytrumpeted initiative for a new middle east
the second demand is for the introduction of a list of safe countries of origin to enable a very clear decision depending on the individual case as to whether or not a claim is justified
member states must conduct their policy in a responsible and autonomous manner
finally mr president i believe that in terms of our approach to sustainable development we must be humble and respectful towards nature which has a memory and may return to haunt us
we also have heroes and heroines of peace and compassion
it is essential of course that these new laws are properly implemented in practice and there is certainly a need for other laws and a new constitution
however convenient it may seem to some to bowdlerise the conclusions of missions however inconvenient it may seem to some to tell the truth about what experienced observers have seen on the ground we have to be absolutely clear on every occasion that our election observation missions have the job of telling it as it is
take a look at all the statistics
it should be pointed out that the united nations commission on human rights approved three such resolutions in succession in and
a council of heads of state or government that fails to decide at this time that it is a mistake for example to strive for even more immigration and to consider integrating turkey a country still way behind us in economic development is in my eyes an incomprehensible council that in any case is making a particularly grave error
because their governments have been supporting this we must guarantee their borders
that would simplify our votes greatly
the head of the ecb is thus appointed by governments often with transactions of low quality and parliamentary supervision is taken away from national parliaments but is not given to the european parliament
in a few weeks time the council of ministers will meet to discuss the funding of the decisions that are to be made in copenhagen extremely important decisions which we in parliament could have had a great deal of influence over
i have seen this happen in my own country sweden
it is true that the european union is ready to cooperate and to contribute to the interception and if necessary to the rescue of ships in the mediterranean

i am bound to give some small privileges and they are of no great consequence to colleagues who have been conspicuous by their presence in the chamber
mr president when i look at our policy towards the palestinians i can see our stick but where is our carrot
honorable members you have provided a strong input to this process since its beginning
for these reasons i did not vote for this report
it is the charter of equality and solidarity the charter of the battle against discrimination of any kind and it is a charter for equality because it enshrines a special attention the special attention that we pay to children and young people to equality between men and women to the role of old people and to the substantial issues of protecting personal rights and personal data
specifically we cannot support the idea of setting up a european police force for sport
with regard to the latter the war in kosovo reminds us of the wisdom of the copenhagen criteria which stipulate amongst other things respect for human rights on the part of all applicant countries as a precondition for their accession to the european union
lastly our proposal will grant all of these rights to passengers flying on both scheduled and charter flights
some of you mentioned the laval case
without going into detail either we too affirm that we must fight against forced labour against child slavery against discrimination of all kinds but also for the promotion of union freedom for the generalization of collective negotiations and as regards labour law for a minimum code in all the countries
we shall vote against the report and stand by small and mediumsized farmers in their fight to overturn everything which the rapporteur takes as given and tries to put a spin on and the antifarming policy which is wiping out and bankrupting european farmers with mathematical precision
the main question however is that of whether the principle of loyal cooperation should take precedence over the right to express oneself
we will deliver whatever we have pledged to deliver and we are also ready to continue the kyoto protocol
recent events in egypt and tunisia have shown that the idea that society in arab countries is not capable of accepting democracy is erroneous
we can overcome poverty and we are the first generation to be able to do so because we have the means available to us
because the framework conditions are so complex and because the development of intermodal transport is still far from being a selfsustaining process we need a great number of successful pilot projects
consequently the proportionality principle may not be invoked in this case
but is management by technocrats any better
whilst clearly agreeing with the commission and my colleagues including mr hatzidakis that we must do all we can to improve road safety across the european union i cannot agree that the way forward would be the introduction of this directive which advocated a onespeedfitsall approach
any concessions must not however penalise the traditional car industry which has done and continues to do a great deal to promote sustainable mobility
mr president this explanation of vote is also shared by arlette laguiller and armonie bordes
we need to take more of a leading role in this regard but overall my assessment is a positive one and i would like to thank you once again commissioner for your efforts
it is unacceptable for employees to find out about decisions affecting their company through the media
however the trading deficit in motion pictures alone between the eu and the united states grows year on year as european audiences choose american rather than european products
i believe the european union has a duty to use the current situation in which despite manipulation of various kinds the zimbabwean oppositions courage has after all won it a major victory to advance democracy and the rule of law in this important african state
that is why i remain convinced that common sense must prevail if we are to prevent the misappropriation of funds because the rural economy could have a very heavy impact in europe
here eu efforts brokered a peace settlement and a peace process that ended a yearlong civil war at the cost of less than a few hours spending in iraq
people whose social decline increasingly excludes them from participating in society and politics and abandons them to their fate
the report is also too optimistic about the possibility of jobs being created
the urgency of the migration issue demands an overall view
one hectare of agricultural land costs times as much in the netherlands as in poland
this is another example of how any argument will be used in order to promote european integration in any and all spheres of policy
but in the context of a peace process that is still so fragile the important thing is not to be carried away by emotion but to take a cool look at the present situation and the progress that has been made in an attempt to obtain a clearer view of the future
it seems extraordinary that the council refuses to endorse the philoxenia programme although we have agreed with the council within the budget the amount necessary to promote the programme
mrs jackson do you have a point of order
he said that it was important that the consumers of the european union had the same confidence in such an institution as us consumers have in their food and drugs administration
security is a basic quality of a democratic society
if you will allow me i will dwell for a moment on the problem of noise pollution suffered at my own country s national airport an airport which by the way many of you frequent very regularly
nevertheless mr bolkestein is convinced that the studies undertaken provide enough clarity and precision to form the basis of the decisionmaking process
he said that politicians should make decisions understandable to the public and react
we should review overly ambitious conservation plans that only allow for short periods for the renewal of fish stocks as is in the case with the cod stocks in the eastern baltic
many institutional problems have been resolved and two years of stalling and uncertainty are drawing to a close
this outcry raises three interesting points
to date we still do not know and i feel the european commission should demand to know what the sunken cargo ship is carrying tonnes of scrap metal possibly hazardous contaminated scrap
at the same time however there was a guarantee that the qualified minority needed to block decisions could not be achieved by a few big member states such as the mediterranean bloc by forming an alliance
cast your minds back to not very long ago despite all the opposition we have stayed on course

we wanted eur billion which is the amount which we would have required for this major undertaking
obviously if we had more resources we could possibly do more work but our resources are limited and we are supposed to manage our resources carefully
our objective has been to emphasise parliaments priorities in the reform process through a succession of informal contacts
even if the environment committees policy document appears to improve on and clarify some points there are nonetheless many uncertainties and problems remaining in relation to the consumer the seller and the danish legal tradition in the area of the sale of goods act
what we have before us is a process of intervention that calls for the application of the same type of monetarist and neoliberal policies and criteria that led to the current crisis particularly affecting the most vulnerable economies
the population density may generally be peoplekm people live by doing lots of different things farming forestry on a very small scale which provides a little money
something else that will be crucial is a clear commitment to cure this and other types of cancer

our christian democrat friends should agree on this even if it involves nonenforceable rights

since the cmo was established producers organisations have in this way enabled a better concentration of community supply of bananas in the market and contributed to a noticeable reduction in the costs relating to the cultivation of bananas in the european union

at the moment aeroplanes account for only of the european unions total greenhouse emissions but the rapid annual increase of almost means that it is now time to act

a system of police cooperation is under construction the europol drugs unit established in has successfully prosecuted cases of organized crime the uclaf antifraud unit which protects the financial interests of the european community has also been very successful however judicial cooperation remains in its infancy as different legal systems in the member states prevent an optimum level of cooperation

mr presidentinoffice of the council my question to you has to do with tax competition which in my view is now a given in europe and an integral element of the internal market
paragraph on the upward harmonisation of tobacco prices paragraph b on a considerable increase in the minimum prices for engine fuels paragraph c on the internalisation of externals costs and paragraph f on an allencompassing taxation basis for mineral oils and their competing products all clearly point in the right direction
you did not do so
mr president ladies and gentlemen allow me to address the council because it is not our directive or the commission proposal that we are debating but the way in which the council has emptied it of all meaning
every vineyard is different in terms of its product and its quality this clearly demonstrates that wine is an agricultural product rather than an industrial product and that it must be treated as such
i get the impression that the committee is building its own virtual view of reality and instead of taking the occasion to give eu citizens a view of reality is for some reason undoubtedly political putting forward its own virtual view as though it were real and thereby misleading the citizens
after the collapse of communism in we expected those communist countries to review their situation and that communism would collapse there too
paradoxically it now seems that national sovereignty is undermining the eus global ambitions as we saw recently over what happened in libya

it is clear that those who rule the eu believe that the enormous profits and revenues which can legally avoid any form of tax burden through a series of exemptions and derogations which are provided for in national tax laws such as revenues from financial products cannot and what is more must not play a role in achieving these aims
the number of selfemployed workers in the united kingdom has risen to million

now however i should like to take a closer look at the third priority sustainable development

in order to counteract these problems without necessitating fundamental changes we have split the amendment into three sections keeping most of the text but taking out the word existing after the second split vote and removing the last sentence after the third split vote as a result of which we have retained the essence but managed to do away with the practical problems
the second practical observation refers on the contrary to failure rather than success

for this reason and even though i can also see a number of my own opinions in certain of the additional amendments tabled i believe that it is crucial both in this debate and in the vote in parliament to maintain the profile of the report a balance achieved in committee which i believe is invaluable to the success of this initiative
therefore greater consideration needs to be given to defining what a region is in europe
i look forward to working with you in the vote tomorrow
why have we had to lend them money
i find it equally difficult to understand the argument that the eu bodies and in particular the european parliament do not have the power to deal with this issue
many people have suffered often losing everything they owned
even if it were properly redirected this aid would not be enough to finance the most basic infrastructure for health care education or drinking water supply
nevertheless for the time being it is better to see the whole picture before we start discussing small details
these inner values are not necessarily what we bring from religious teaching but i feel they are a biological factor we are already equipped with warmheartedness or a sense of responsibility a sense of community
we are not convinced by the criticism being levelled at them either
for our group the important factors are biodiversity the environment health and food safety
the first very immediate threat is the threat to our daytoday security from islamist and other terrorist groups such as eta in spain
if we give entrepreneurs this scope it is important that we lay down clear rules on use and safety
mr president commissioner nielson the lack of respect for ilo labour rights perpetuates poverty and hampers development by driving wages down and denying education something that constitutes a violation of human dignity
we should also be prepared to begin consideration of measures that will help bring turkey closer to our values and our economic approach
we can see difficulties in acceptance of cooperation in the northern countries if no efforts are discernible here for securing the aid by a functioning administration
i do not mean to point the finger but rather to allow those member states who might be overusing antibiotics to improve their animal husbandry practices
it is i believe still a little early to reply fully to all the questions you have raised
assimilation capacity is also defined here the main problem is that the european unions capacity to assimilate the new members is in part dependent on the agreement in principle of the people in the member states
year by year we shall reexamine the situation of the various candidate countries
the countries of southeast europe have definite prospects of joining the eu in the next decade but truth and clarity also require an acknowledgment that pushing ahead with the accession of turkey would undermine the eu
this demonstrates that quite typically it is not the interests of the workers and the people of the region that is motivating the eu
equal representation in the european commission and european parliament may be our political signal for a better representation of women in all decisionmaking bodies and implicitly for eliminating these pay gaps
the brussels summit did not say a single word in even mild condemnation of this crime against the iraqi people
on the contrary if we follow a policy of proper handling of animals all the protective measures all the precautions we take are much more effective
mr president it is a sad fact that whatever continent one looks at there seems to be civil war and genocide with its appalling consequences
building on this a resolution from the european parliament that would underline the main messages already passed by the eu would be very valuable
will the empire continue for a long time to play with islamic fundamentalism and will it continue to receive the backing of those who support it unconditionally
but in any case i hope i may look forward to the new joint actions by the council
many of the survivors remained silent out of shame about their past and were stigmatised and relegated to the fringes of society
those involved in commercial operations shall hold an attestation as initially described in
he has stuck to his principles and shown flexibility in defending the vital points while yielding over instrumental or auxiliary aspects
paragraph calls for funding for transnational political parties
in this framework the commission is about to launch a pilot project with the russian administration on monitoring maritime traffic in the baltic sea
mr president ladies and gentlemen i would like to join my colleagues in thanking mr fischbach for his work
commercial pressure is certain to destroy any research whose aim is above all to promote social wellbeing
we now have rules on how to go ahead with the european baccalaureate
their number has increased significantly and it is impossible for the european parliament not to react to those reports and to what they denounce
finally mr president and to reply to the oral questions raised by the different political groups you will understand that it is not possible to take a position today on the conclusions of the report of the temporary committee to follow up the recommendations on bse as due to lack of time it has not been possible for the council to study this report
nevertheless i think that the amendments succeed in improving the texts from the point of view that i just specified quality of products and correct consumer information
the commission has found no evidence of any discrimination against other working languages as a result of this rule which was drawn up on the instructions of both the current and former presidents of the commission
however we must double our efforts to find an alternative to ddt because huge damage is being done to humans it is biocumulative and to our environment by our need to look after the children who are here today
we wrote a joint open letter to a specific newspaper in germany and set out our view of the allegations
it was a dynamic loss because this is a growing sector and over time the problems would deepen especially in the context of the liberalized market we face from now on
we must then impose on our multinationals a code of conduct which protects weak economies governments and peoples against arbitrariness and exploitation
mr president when welcoming the words of president medvedev on the importance of civil rights and rule of law the eu should make it absolutely clear that the credibility of his statements can be measured only by showing first of all full respect for the verdicts of the european court of human rights and contributing to the reform of this body
territorial cohesion has long been the subject of debate
it is statistical progress but it needs to be given more substance if we are to make real progress along the road to the reduction of unemployment
so i ask you to contribute to the councils reform of itself to have it as a legislature always sitting in public and always present here when important debates take place in parliament
commissioner i hope that the issue of the environment and employment will play a particularly important role in the debate which will take place in the next six months
if there is a feeling that article should also be included because we are dealing with disparate products that can naturally be done too
we therefore also applaud welcome and support the proposal to include acts of terrorism as crimes against humanity within the context of the jurisdiction of the international criminal court so that that court can deal with them as well
it is only right that in denmark we are seeing a debate on political union at the moment as the danes decide whether to join the euro or not
anyway what is the purpose of this owninitiative report
the actions of the hong kong monetary authority may not have pleased classical economists but their response bore the hallmark made in hong kong and not made in china
we have a part to play in shaping the process of structural change which is taking place throughout eastern europe a process intensified and accelerated by the prospect of accession to the eu just as we are involved in the structural change that our member states must undergo in dealing with an industrial policy which has to some extent run its course
as the second trading partner for the region europe leads the field in investment which is considerably higher than investment by china
it is of course conceivable as a longterm objective and it is something the partnership and cooperation agreement committees could deal with
what is apparent then to me from what is going on politically is that there is a system of values that matters to all the people of europe and that they want to join together in defending
implicit in this report are western cultural values which make a presumption against the rights of women in islam
fulfil your obligations to parliament in a generous spirit thus preparing for the future
two aspects of the text warrant some criticism firstly in order to reduce the number of births or to improve the sanitary conditions of these births it fails to present and does even less to promote any alternative solution to the use of mass contraception which is seen as a basic right secondly the report even includes abortion in a number of measures to be funded to which the eu is asked to contribute without bothering to find out what the policies in at least some member states in this field are
at the same time it is a truly exceptional bank because it is indeed funded by taxpayers money
i appreciate the commissioners contribution and that of the chairman of the committee on social affairs and employment stephen hughes and indeed all the contributors who have been so supportive this morning
as a result the situation is going to become extremely worrying
please trust me to remain objective
in my capacity as rapporteur i would like to make a brief statement for the benefit of members
i urge that we keep national traditions but at the same time advance democracy in the world of work at the european level
in europe the average consumer credit interest rate varies from around in finland the cheapest member state to over in portugal
it has not been that way for a little while now however
i should say that it came to this decision with regret and in awareness of sacrificing parliaments absolute right to contribute to the amendment of this regulation but bowed to the political priority of finally completing all the investigative procedures for this regulation to enter into force as soon as possible it was also aware that the equilibrium reached with the january compromise was already very fragile and bringing any of it back into discussion would probably have meant difficulty finding another point of equilibrium and another point of consensus
it is a waste for those of us who were relying on their contribution
the measures proposed are commendable and consist of
there are many areas in which we do not just need more statistics but also innovative suggestions for problemsolving
amnesty international has recently published a report about the freedom of the press about the lack of religious freedom and about the general human rights situation in russia
you have before you a competent and efficient commission and i can assure you that as its leader i will devote all my energies to achieving these objectives and to ensuring that the men and women of europe notice what has changed
worse by imposing policies on haiti that we now know did not work international institutions europe and its partners have exacerbated the fragility of its social fabric its economy and its institutions
i also hope that the alarm sounded by our members on visiting your country has been heard by all of the people responsible and that both your government and the unions institutions will do what they can effectively to ensure that the admission policy in europe shows greater respect for the citizens of other countries who try to come to ours
that was somewhat paradoxical from an honourable member whom i think of as an evangelist for european fragmentation especially since if the advice he offered was followed it would constitute the most massive act of superordinate centralisation in the history of the union
in general europe lacks a common health strategy and policy
none of these europes is immune from political or cultural diversions which might distort their democratic image not even the first europe
i voted in favour because i agree that in its capacity as colegislator parliament should be able to monitor the adoption of strategic decisions about where and how development aid is spent on an equal footing with the council
regionalisation is one of the key requirements from this point of view for our attempt to manage this policy through centralisation has failed
this should be handled within the family and in communities in other words close to home
i simply hope that in the meantime the council will display a little more consideration and cooperation as regards matters falling under the codecision procedure
rapporteur mr president ladies and gentlemen i should like to say that i have had great pleasure in drafting this report and that i am grateful to all my colleagues and all the shadow rapporteurs
the ban on the use of sidefacing seats in passenger cars goods vehicles and certain categories of buses is also to be welcomed
this was not a foregone conclusion because given the history of our various countries a painful history for those europeans who lived for so many years behind the iron curtain in a humiliated europe a divided europe a sacrificed europe it was quite natural that certain countries would have different feelings towards our russian neighbours from those who have only known freedom
from now on the euro will give us notes and coins and a slight increase in economic growth as a consequence of uncertainties being eliminated
some may think that israel has found a strange way to express that support in recent weeks
in other words we are now paying out aid at different levels of support and ending up with comparable payments
as far as further bold european projects are concerned it is both a connecting link between them and a stumbling block
but it now emerges from the trialogue meeting last week that the commission will be proposing an increase of eur million
the aims that provide the market with additional sensitivity or idealism however particularly the fight for a project which is able to reconcile the goals of economic development and those of social and political development cannot be reached unless there is a high degree of cooperation between the member states at all levels specifically at the diplomatic level
everyone or nearly everyone has his or her kalashnikov and uses it
bold community funding is more than needed in order to avoid all this
the most important thing to remember is that public services are not under threat from gats
mr president if there is one point on which the european union cannot compromise in its relations with associated countries it is that of human rights and democracy
clearly not all courses of action have been taken but it is equally clear that regarding this specific fact there is a case for an assessment to be made and for a political opinion to be issued
as you have all underlined the challenge with our air security policy is to find a reasonable balance between the need to protect passengers against terrorist activity and of course the operational aspects at airports in order to avoid overcomplicated checking procedures
to meet these major energy challenges effectively community energy policy should focus more upon specific aims it should be more integrated and it must certainly be better coordinated than are the other community policies
the hague programme adopted by the european council on and november also tackles this problem and calls for cooperation between the member states to be stepped up
nevertheless i can assure you that the commission will take your observations into account during the forthcoming negotiations on this proposal in the council
mental illness also belongs to this list though
on behalf of the vertsale group mr president ladies and gentlemen the union for the mediterranean has never been as vital to our future as it is today
the issue is as much to benefit from any overshoots as to arrive at an extraordinary setaside rate specific to each farm
is the commission considering ways of preventing national measures on the taxation of passenger air traffic such as a tax on tickets or aviation fuel becoming an obstacle to the internal market
there are currently insufficient funds available for many regions educational exchanges including for senior secondary vocational training knowledge and employment promotion funds for national plans to create new jobs in regions threatened with delocalisation vital rural and nature management border control security in europe and the fight against global poverty which brings me to development cooperation
member states local authorities employers social partners and community institutions must actively seek to ensure the success of this action plan and the measures that have now been presented must be taken into account in the revision of the european employment strategy
mr president the eradication of poverty is a key international objective of the eu
global problems must be solved in the un
then a new basis from the convention of the time will be put to the vote
i therefore see no link between the closure of ignalina and security of supply in the baltic region
i am particularly thinking of mr louis michel foreign affairs minister and mr elio di rupo the chairman of the walloon parti socialiste
in europe will keep its priorities on target
the action plan provides us with the opportunity to use this experience to help others and i hope parliament will support it
it is really they who are the major beneficiaries of the agreement
as an example of that i want to show you this book which will be coming out in two weeks time under the title the politics of the past the use and abuse of history and in which we especially left the floor to historians and we hope that this will really contribute to the quality of the debate in this parliament and of course elsewhere
we intend to be proactive and know that in all the issues which we discuss we will need the active support of parliament
i do not share that view i think there are good reasons why the eu should reconsider its alcohol policy and the swedish experience is important in that context
is it not important that we should give them as much protection as we can against the tremendous american interests which with their enormous capital and enormous propaganda potential which we have felt are trying to invade our market to destroy those bananas being produced on european territory
that is one aspect that will be weighed in the balance in coming to a conclusion on this issue
the declaration referred to articles and pursuant to which we shall have to hold these debates in the future between our various institutions
traceability however must be ensured
improving the energy performance of buildings is particularly important in increasing the eus general energy efficiency and in reducing greenhouse gas emissions
i am therefore very happy that my group has submitted mr rugovas name for the next sakharov prize
but we need simple administration
now that we are beginning to draw up solutions for resolving other consumer protection issues many people have expressed doubts as to the need to find common solutions in the eu
my colleagues and i are prepared to consider whether there are practical possibilities of compiling enforceable proposals on such matters whilst at the same time being conscious of the reality that support for such initiatives may not be readily given in practice in any council of member state ministers
i should therefore like the european parliaments key message to the victims of the chernobyl disaster today to be one of solidarity solidarity which must translate into practical aid for the people of ukraine
the previous vote was not for or against this report as i see it sounding a note of caution simply amounts to giving egypt the importance due to it as a country
i hope the resolution accompanying this debate will receive a strong vote in this house tomorrow and i hope it will strengthen the hands of the commission and the council in pressuring both israel and hamas to stop the killing
treating dangerous and nondangerous waste in the same way therefore exacerbates the problem
presenting another question for oral answer today following the latest commission interim report presented by commissioner kroes an accompanying resolution will follow in the coming week practically continues the tradition from the previous parliamentary term
mr president the s have been characterised in europe by a proliferation of security laws surveillance repression detention and imprisonment
mr izquierdo collado is not content with analyzing these conclusions but goes further by placing the future reform of the structural funds within the perspective of the two major challenges of years to come the enlargement of the union and the single currency and on this basis developing a number of recommendations for the future of cohesion
can we agree an outline on the way forward for the constitutional and institutional debate
mr president i have voted in favour of the capoulas santos report and of amendment which recommends a franchise of eur for the modulation
as you know under the irish constitution the rights of children are seen as best protected in the context of the family
because we would have liked to have seen more progress in the mainstream of further political reforms
changing the european heritage label into an eu initiative will help make it more credible visible and prestigious
in response to your question however i should like to point out that we have preaccession instruments and that these are what we should be using when the time comes to carry accession through successfully
mr president let me just reiterate the point that as i recall it the conference of presidents resolved unanimously something it very rarely does to ask the chairman of the convention to join us for this partsession
it should instead aim for limited cooperation on significant and genuinely crossborder issues
the most important task for the people s movement against the eu is to internationalise grassroots opposition to the eu project as a whole and to work for a free europe in which there are full opportunities for open cooperation that are not stymied by the eu s closed supranational bureaucracy
there are also factual errors in mr belders report which is supported by the ppede group and other groups
i would also to point out an inconsistency
however the combined national indicative targets emerging in the europe discussions give a result that is clearly more ambitious than that but still likely to be well below the
i think we need exactly the same with regard to the missions that we have had so far
the various speeches have reflected the abundance of important issues even though we need to concentrate our political attention and energy on the three essential points i have raised reform of the institutions foreign policy and the cfsp and the followup to lisbon
therefore here in this assembly let us accept our responsibilities
above all elderly people must be entitled to a decent pension enabling them to live life with dignity
fourthly we are in the middle of the process of ratifying the european constitution and the citizens sometimes show even more enthusiasm than their representatives
in this sense the proposed directive represents an important step towards increasing the level of consumer protection in the european union
irregular mass immigration and the humanitarian tragedy that it represents have consequences for security and cohesion throughout the european community
madam president the question of how to finance an expensive road infrastructure makes the debate on the imposition of charges on heavy goods vehicles a very topical one throughout europe and especially in austria
however such dialogue should not substitute but complement and reinforce turkeys accession track
the treatment of mrs bonino who has given so much help to afghan refugees should certainly reinforce the unions protest
mr president i should simply like to say that i tried in my report to present a genuinely comprehensive picture of the economic and trade aspects and to link these as is the practice in the committee on external economic relations with an assessment of the political context which is essential for an objective evaluation
furthermore we will need objective information from reliable governmental and nongovernmental sources research centres and various segments of civil society such as religious organisations and we must work closely together in defence of our fundamental rights
the rights concerned openness and data protection complement and reinforce each other
i can only hope that we and the commissioner can push this through together in the council
furthermore trading insults across the atlantic serves no purpose and only makes matters worse
what we need is more resources for the caterer to ensure that none of our family or our guests leaves our educational table unfed or hungry
my first point is about the terminology we are using today
efforts to promote research paving the way for the production of secondgeneration biofuels are also important
the dover disaster has once again opened our eyes to the unscrupulous practices of traffickers in human beings and to the powerlessness or should that be unwillingness on the part of the european union to stamp out this disgraceful type of exploitation
triangular trade has therefore continued to expand and garlic production in the community is moving ever closer to extinction
as i have said many times i am certainly not going to reopen the tobacco reform
also years of work have already gone into this topic
at present there are people in the camp at sangatte who are firmly committed to opposing terrorism
the ageing of europes population is linked to an increase in the number of people who fall victim to agerelated diseases
this situation contributed greatly to paving the way for violence and war
in writing i welcome this report and estonias entry into the eurozone
for these reasons i was unable to vote for this report
mr president commissioner presidentinoffice of the council people are those who determine the value of things so said the ancient greeks
the european union will of course need to be convinced in other areas that it does not lack in the ostentatious display of power
all in all it is the commission s intention to transfer more responsibility to the member states in the customs field
frankly we are not flexible enough
all these lists will be ineffective and so i urge the nation states to at last do the homework to which they have agreed and get a grip on dealing with this crossborder phenomenon rather than constantly making new speeches to absolve themselves of blame whenever a terrorist act is carried out after which yet again nothing happens
secondly there is a limited number of qualified researchers
all these elements require a new level of cooperation between member states and european institutions
what the lisbon economic and social policy guidelines are promoting what is in practice being prepared for working people and served up under a misnamed modernisation intended to sugar the pill deceive working people and reduce public reaction against the antilabour and antigrass roots economic and social policy of the eu is a minimum level of poverty and not a minimum level of prosperity
unemployment as a whole is something that worries us
the integrity of a european food authority will be based on independence and strong scientific leadership in the field of food safety
one thing is certain the controls have not worked
it is vital to guarantee that parliament has the right to participate in the regulatory procedure
suffering and tragedy will continue to mark the days and nights in palestine if israel and the wider international community do not take action to restore international and human rights
there are millions of citizens in this region who need to rekindle this hope by symbolically going through again now in the forthcoming months the events of the prague spring
my answer is yes we can but to do so we need courage and not shyness
we respect this result and will support president abu mazen as he tries to put together a government that will be strong in its defence of international law and in its opposition to violence
we do not need more centralist regulation in this field if we really want to unleash the forces of growth in the eu we need more competition between the individual national social security systems
the support we so magnanimously demand for this or that represents money taken from the pockets of taxpayers mothers and fathers who decide every month what is their real priority and what will have to wait
are we to take this to mean that for example warner brothers would work together with isps almost like deputy sheriffs
mr president ladies and gentlemen the problem of iraq seems to have divided the world into two opposing camps
i can only thank them for this for there is no doubt that over and above the general intention of introducing ones own ideas into a report the ultimate goal is to improve the report itself and its effectiveness in the common general interest
let those who will continue to ratify the treaty
there has however been no request for an amendment
it is far better than what the pse group rapporteur suggested in the first place which was ms
common rules for the internal market in electricity
the bank can retort that it is independent
mr president as you know the report will go to the bureau tonight and until it has been to the bureau it is not an official document of this house
we have seen a decline in the bee population in many regions of europe
this is true of unanimous decisionmaking which still applies today in many sectors and it is therefore even more true when it comes to bringing policies up to date a process which we are unable to tackle now
parliament has new powers
to cite an example we would call your attention to the various funds channelled towards the enlargement policy sometimes we do not know where they end up
i voted in favour of the report on the temporary suspension of the autonomous common customs tariff duties on imports of certain industrial products in the autonomous regions of the azores and madeira as this aims to increase the competitiveness of economic operators from the azores this would ensure more stable employment in the azores and thus overcome the economic disadvantages that exist due to the islands location
it is true that the document to which mrs schaffners report relates exists only in french
the arguments of mining companies that they can ensure conditions for gold mining that will prevent the risk of damage to health or the environment have always proved worthless
or is it the india with million people living on less than a dollar a day where two out of five of people are illiterate and where the socalled it revolution only touches one in fifty indians
the commission thinks that this is another worrisome development in the framework of freedom of expression in china
i fear that this delay will continue in the field
in my view proper implementation of the posting of workers directive by all member states and increased administrative cooperation among them would provide adequate means of guaranteeing on the one hand the protection of workers rights and on the other the freedom to provide services
it is also true that various ministers in their speeches at the last council and in a letter that they have sent to me have expressed their concern at the situation
moreover it is a government like the situation in greece that is acting in part against the will of its own electorate and then we have some tactical play from the opposition party which is putting the screws on the government
we shall also ask them to make a gesture of responsibility in this open dialogue we should like to hear the prayers in mosques sometimes more and more often include a clear strong condemnation of any act that seeks to destroy human life
women are bountifully offered flexible forms of employment with the result that they provide cheap labour receive less money for the same job and face worse problems of job insecurity and unequal access to the labour market it is still mainly women who fill the more menial unskilled jobs and who rarely hold responsible higher management jobs in economic social and political life
commissioner lamy recently said that by import quotas will have been abolished but our commitment to the industry will not waver
the european grouping of territorial cooperation is a new means of endowing teams for cooperation between regional and local authorities from different eu member states with legal personality
this is why the group union for europe cannot vote in favour of a resolution which is clearly misguided and which proves yet again that instead off acting so selfimportantly some members of our assembly would be better advised to put aside their textbooks on ideology and carefully appraise the facts
finally i shall take advantage of this debate to inform parliament that as part of the first european sme week more than national regional and local events will be held concerning a wide range of issues affecting this sector
what stand did the commission take when faced with this evidence
the stress that is put on improving the quality of the information made available so that it is comprehensible accurate and comparable is also very valuable
it is all very well for us by mutual consensus to make an effort in terms of budgetary rationalisation but you must be very aware that the lack of resources the absence of financial autonomy and the poor execution of the budget continue to be urgent issues which must be resolved
i would therefore ask you mr president to remove this item from the agenda and not make us look complete fools because otherwise we will open the floodgates to repeats of each vote whose outcome is not to the councils liking
it has been drawn to my attention in the short time i have been in this house that there are foreign language lecturers in italy who for eleven years have had rights declared by the european court of justice effectively denied by a member state of this union
i think we can neutralise this risk with this financing
i hope that we can make those member states which are still opposed see sense
it is therefore appropriate to thank all the groups for their cooperation and confirm once again to the commission that it can rely on the active cooperation of the european parliament in the implementation of this plan and we will not disregard our duties but exercise them responsibly
but in its absence we have no alternative but to vigorously defend our position and the interests of europes economy competitivity and jobs
mr president ladies and gentlemen to put it simply the group of the party of european socialists will vote in favour of mr posselts report
however as i said earlier we believe that it would be premature to set new limit values and thus we cannot support amendments nos and
those eu member states whose vessels operate in third countries waters should be liable for the costs of the agreements
on the basis of the experience we have had with russia over many years its reliability as a partner can be taken as read but we also have to realise that the difficulties with ukraine were a wakeup call for us
the recent political crisis is a strong signal from the people of georgia who have shown their determination to fight for democracy while the financial and economic situation in the country is catastrophic and corruption is on the increase
i would remind you that italy was sentenced by the court of justice in march but for actions discovered and dealt with in
we confirm that we will deliver on what we have been obliged to do and as has been promised in the iia on budget reform by the end this year
it will also be important for businesses in facilitating greater crossborder trade particularly of course for smes
in this context i would like to openly praise the rapporteur and thank him for including in his report a demand which my group has been making in this house for a long time
moreover it is through this identity that the member states contribute to a common legal culture
i would ask you to be reasonable and not to insist because we cannot ascertain whether personal comments have been made
i am thinking in particular of a dialogue with islam which is particularly alert to the religious dimension of those with whom it is in dialogue
some of these measures have already been submitted to the greek parliament and are to be implemented shortly
solidarity regarding energy will and can serve freedom
i may remind you of the conclusions of cannes essen and madrid
briefly some work has been done on that matter mostly it is done by national authorities but there is a certain element of coordination between what they do and what we are doing at commission level
i did so because there is an obvious risk of what are at present counted as food supplements being redefined in future as medicines
i wish to express my support for the report and my gratitude to the rapporteur for his commitment
the one size fits all rule that is proposed in the report certainly does not work in this case
however solidarity should be in the direction which the people of iran want and not in the direction the imperialists want
to conclude let me say that we do not yet have a fullyfledged european model for innovation but what is clear is that it must be rooted in a wellorchestrated concrete strong and joint publicprivate effort
it is necessary to reassess the locations of existing nuclear plants particularly according to the risk of earthquakes and the risk that a tsunami will occur
madam president the seattle conference ended in failure
however i think that the criticism of the business impact assessment system currently used by the commission is excessive
that is the aim of enlargement to unite the whole of europe in a european union
furthermore at a time of dramatic crisis resulting from the financial collapse it is impossible to imagine that in addition to our own unemployed we will have the problem of the unemployed from outside the eu who will by force of circumstance pose a problem to civil order and the security of our peoples
the official checks the cargo it is radioactive material all in order with all the necessary permits
solving problems in the countries from which people are migrating to the european union is the main basis for avoiding this sometimes tragic situation
mr president the work of the emcdda is for me one of the best examples of the eu having a common goal a joint interest and an added value because drugs and drug addiction have a damaging effect on society
on the subject of security priority will be given to improving coordination in the fight against terrorism and organised crime
when it came to launching legislative owninitiative reports the chairman of the committee on economic and monetary affairs rejected this for a long time on account of an unnecessary dispute over competences
mrs corbey i heard your first comments and am very concerned about your lifestyle
as you know the committee on womens rights has the exclusive privilege of being invited once a year to a oneday meeting with the president of the commission mr prodi and ten commissioners in order to discuss the specific issue of gender equality
i wish above all that you had not had to take the blame for a policy possibly cooked up for you by others
according to the honourable member the ministry has stopped issuing information on this matter
we therefore need as the amendment applies to the whole to vote first on the corrigendum
in so doing the heads of state and government took an important step and spoke out clearly in favour of giving more support to renewable energy sources
also negotiations with the countries of central and eastern europe must be conducted individually taking into account their specific characteristics and providing for adequate transition periods in order to safeguard important production sectors in the current member states such as agriculture textiles and steel
it is a hugely important democratic principle that the people in this case the bulgarians should have as much information as possible when they go to the polls
secondly in regard to defence policy we are currently talking and for the time being we are merely talking but i hope we will soon be taking concrete steps about a european defence identity
but that will be of no use unless there is confidence in that stability throughout the region
first it would be appropriate to incorporate into the treaty on union a genuine charter of childrens rights and then ensure compliance with that charter not just in europe but elsewhere too especially through the agency of europol
the question is not only whether the countries are able to adopt the legislation but also whether they are able to implement it in practice
the united states has stood in the way of an agreement and is even pressuring some countries to give up the right to import generic medicines
in my opinion this is a very difficult subject and one over which we will lament the passing of the portuguese presidency for at least on this point it maintained a position which if not crystal clear was at least less negative
should we not be asking ourselves why in the same worldwide economic situation japan and the united states have managed to turn growth into jobs
i am pleased that we are finally taking concrete steps to reduce the bureaucracy involved in accessing european funds
in the same way we must consider intensifying the existing link between the environment and road safety
the commission undertook to report on its experiences after the first two years of application of these new rules that is by the spring of
the commission shares the determination that you have shown in this field
it is for this reason that i regard mr katiforis report as very important in that it is the first in europe to give attention to this topic
we see the foundation playing a role in that
that is why i very much hope that the european commission and the european council will stand shoulder to shoulder with us and help us in our struggle
this would mean that extra rules would constantly have to be dreamt up
the congoeu voluntary partnership agreement provides for a series of political and legislative reforms which will enable the republic of congos timber sector to institute good governance practices and greater transparency
regarding the possibility of preserving existing systems and implementing the environmental guarantee this is a choice made by the individual member state and it is not possible for me to take any decision here today as to how right or wrong it would be for sweden to do something like this or say something about the outcome
i would now ask the last few speakers to be very brief
i should like to point out that nine of the cases closed in are examples of best practice
we as a group in parliament are happy to have further discussions with you on these matters
nevertheless i do not believe the problem can be solely examined in the light of romanticism and moral indignation it must also be the opportunity to see what perverse mechanisms of international trade are permitting the expansion of all these misdeeds
it is very important to remind us of the schuman plan grounded on solidarity first of all at the beginning of the european union and then in the s last century in central and eastern europe today on the financial markets and in the very near future in the mediterranean region

it is my view that we need some oecd agreements in this area
mr president if i may i would like to thank the rapporteur for a very refreshing new approach
in these circumstances it is quite reasonable for this house to express concern today asking an oral question which urges the commission to show the definite and unquestionable feasibility studies which to date no one has seen
today i voted in favour of the extension of peace funding but i did so with considerable reservation
this applies also for those member states which have not yet joined the eurozone
there are many other areas where i think you will find that the commission has tried to accommodate parliaments wishes
since the first publication of this directive back in the manufacturers have moved to meet the commission standards
in writing we welcome the commissions proposal for an action plan on the protection and welfare of animals
a special problem in this context is the fact that in austria above all in recent decades the profits from telecommunications have been used to fill other gaps in the budget
let us remind ourselves how the prodi commission took office in the autumn of grandiosely committing itself to and demanding zero tolerance for fraud and irregularities
i am glad to vote for this report today and glad to see that the need to balance the eus emphasis on trade with a strong social angle is being taken forward at the initiative of this parliament
the european union
i am not very pleased with the content of our joint resolution nor am i very pleased with the performance of council president sarkozy
the governing communist party no longer has anything to do with rebellious movements of workers and farmers who fought against exploitation and lawlessness in years gone by
he was most cooperative while drafting his report
the reason the price package actually exists is in order to define the appropriate production conditions for the next financial year to the extent that those conditions are within the jurisdiction of the council and parliament
mr martin that is of course a matter for your group alone and has nothing to do with this house
let me also emphasise strongly that we need closer cooperation between the european countries and between monetary financial and wage policy
i would stress the need for greater efforts to ensure that any new protocol is subject to a proper control system and that there is adequate transparency in the operation of the agreement
mr president a quarter of a century has passed since willy brandt presented his report on northsouth relations
we will therefore maintain the summit with our neighbour morocco
mr cabezon alonso has the floor on a point of order
every region this is why right at the beginning of the single market and the single market act the president of the commission jacques delors wanted to support the construction of the single market with a cohesion policy so that even regions that are behind in terms of development can also take part in the battle for growth and competitiveness all regions including the most distant outermost regions
only then will russia be able once and for all to drop the millstone of its stalinist past from around its neck and to stop fighting against its own citizens who are currently risking their lives to defend fundamental freedoms and human rights

because the draft strategy is still under internal consultation within the commission i am not able to provide many details on its contents
firstly it is proposed that the taxation systems of the member states should function properly secondly that better operation should be achieved by means of cooperation between the tax administrations responsible for applying it and thirdly that the better operation resulting from cooperation should serve to eradicate fraud
we have not yet been satisfied with the way that this occurs through the commission
on that point i do not at all agree with him
i am now pleased to hand over to my colleague poul nielson who will speak amongst other things about the need for followup and implementation of our wssd commitments
what we are talking about here is the composition of that european citizenship which we need to deepen
joint financing of the first pillar of the common agricultural policy must be rejected
allow me to mention some other things that i believe are very important for steering europe through the crisis
we also believe that the unions policies and the sectoral policies of the member states must focus on the achievement of cohesion objectives and sustainable development plans for the regions
we shall not create jobs by adopting regulations and declarations of intent
a european perspective and new steps are essential for responding to these needs and especially for adequately tackling the supervision of crossborder groups and moving forward with the prevention and management of international crises
we are so glad to have it at last that one is wary of being overcritical of it
there were huge problems in carrying out the study due to the large number of funds in greece and there were problems due to the auxiliary insurance funds and more importantly as the result of shortcomings in the computer system

mr president i would like to congratulate mr juncker and his dedicated political colleagues in his excellent diplomatic and civil service on the job they have done over the last six months
it was precisely because the postal services were to some degree sheltered from competition and from the pursuit of profit that they were able to perform their role it was because they did not exist to be profitmaking but to provide a service that they served the most secluded villages and crisscrossed the land with a dense network of post offices
it was only a few weeks ago that a resolution with largely the same content was defeated and rejected by a unanimous acp delegation in lome togo
the reason why they are refusing to do it is that these policy areas the security of external borders asylum the law on citizenship freedom of establishment and movement police and justice policy give them an opportunity to say to their citizens it is we not anyone else who hold the reins of power in this state
mr president economic growth should serve to improve the material situation of our societies
from october onwards the ecbs monetary policy can be described as active and flexible
i should like to protest that i as an mp which is what i am i shall be speaking on behalf of my group later get what amounts to a ban on speaking for expressing an opinion on the subject that i have never concealed
in the wake of the recent unilateral attack perpetrated by the us air force and navy against iraq this action poses a new and grave threat to world peace
that is the actual reason why the commission has to ensure that we create this economic and legal framework to enable the member states with these systems to retain them
then there is the calculation and exportation of preretirement benefits
there is something we can do immediately to tell mr mugabe that our opinions do matter
mr president ladies and gentlemen i believe that as a european parliament we have no choice but to associate ourselves with the universal condemnation of the nuclear tests apparently carried out by north korea
this charter is a good thing and even a success in that it has been implemented in countries
this recommendation on the draft council decision concerning the conclusion of a protocol to the euromediterranean agreement establishing an association between the european communities and their member states of the one part and the hashemite kingdom of jordan of the other part to take account of the accession of the republic of bulgaria and of romania to the european union deserves my vote
i have to say that a section of the epp group were playing games on this issue
the slowdown in growth has intensified over the past few months and the eurozone deficit has risen from of gdp in the year to in
according to recent estimates from the european court of auditors the volume of fraud is now on a par with the european union budget
representatives of all parties and ethnic groups should be able to contribute to a new draft constitution before it is submitted to a referendum
there are various member states as my fellow member has just said which are not particularly inclined to standardise soil protection at european level
the united states should obviously be able to keep the peace in its own backyard also militarily
and you have of course included the point in your report about discussing the matter further to inform you of what the conclusions will be and about the responses we have obtained nearly all of which have now been received
this debate is particularly relevant because at a time of economic growth and somewhat contradictorily of budget cuts and cuts in social expenditure a lot of talk about concepts such as competitiveness and employability and work ethics in societies where there are high rates of female unemployment and insecure jobs some models are beginning to make an impact these models obviously imported from across the atlantic appear to call into question the social benefits which protect these women and their families and in some cases label them as social parasites who deliberately abuse the social welfare system
i would in particular like to focus on three elements which in addition to those cited by other members i feel are the most sensitive points and those which require swift action to be taken
on behalf of the alde group mr president the alde group is of the opinion that laos and vietnam are no democracies
it is for these reasons that the meps of the communist party of greece voted against the deva report which is little more than a manifesto for the globalisation party
finally a reference point for the preparation of my report was also last years de rossa report on the european ombudsmans report
i would like to pay tribute to that
i am not unaware of the many problems that a radical revision of the unions current system of institutional representation in multilateral international bodies would lead to in particular as regards potentially strengthening the eus position in the un
resources for this programme must also be increased as favourable circumstances arise
i maintain it all comes to the same thing and that only honourable members skilled in hairsplitting could come up with differences in meaning between these various phrases
the european union asserted itself as an incorruptible negotiating partner and mediator
i believe it is necessary to identify real portfolios for commissioners but i cannot understand why they should be reduced just when the commissions powers are being widened
i urge them even at this late stage to vote against these amendments to vote for jobs to vote for reform and to vote for barcelona
ladies and gentlemen will be a crucial year for the enlargement process and we know that as we have heard the spanish presidency will be making every effort to keep up the momentum so that we can conclude negotiations this year with those countries that have shown that they meet the criteria for accession
my question would be should the european union shift its focus from advertisements which are commissioned by manufacturers
many times in the past we have seen how difficult it is to reconcile the interests of all member states in the matter of the eu patent and so i am all the more grateful to the swedish presidency for the compromise for the moment only at the political level which has been achieved
i should now like madam president to examine the second proposal by the commission and with this in mind to thank the rapporteur mr gallagher
can i conclude by informing colleagues of some good news from the united states which i have just received which is that the us administration has decided to put the revolutionary guards on the terrorist list
todays resolution is a relatively mild call on the sri lankan authorities to respect the rights of their citizens
this provision does not figure either in the commissions draft directive or in the report by mr rothley and the committee on legal affairs and citizens rights although it had been included in the previous draft
at that time the european union was more than a hope
the list of safe states will be used as a pretext for further encouraging a hasty examination and the systematic rejection of requests
the animals and vehicles must be inspected on departure and sample inspections will also be done during transportation if need be
i would though like to sound a clear warning that we may be improving the law on the award of public contracts in technical terms and making it more manageable but at the same time causing its substance to deteriorate
i believe the federal government understands that and indeed the minister of justice has also condemned the verdict
in turn the programme for education and lifelong learning helps to develop the union as an advanced knowledgebased society in accordance with the objectives of the lisbon strategy
unfortunately i read this morning that the commissioner had taken to the barricades again opposing the milk fund
the rapporteur mentions such projects in the mediterranean this also suggests that the member states should be able to enforce conservation measures themselves since it is they who know most about the state of resources
member states should promote the individualisation of pension rights without abolishing the derived rights of the surviving spouse and children
it is certainly true to say that because of the extent of european community law it is now difficult to make decisions using an approach based solely on international law
if there is mutual trust between the legal systems and in the member states laws then even the possibility that such reservations could exist is incomprehensible
this further deepens the legal uncertainty of employees
meanwhile while awaiting the possible adoption and entry into force of the draft constitutional treaty there is a need in the field of financial services without this establishing a precedent for flexible regulating mechanisms although the institutional balance must be fully maintained
the committee on legal affairs has indicated that article is the correct legal basis as has parliaments legal service
mr president honourable members of the european parliament mr president of the commission ladies and gentlemen i am both honoured and delighted to be here today in my role as presidentinoffice of the european council to present the priorities of the greek presidency
we helped them and carried out repairs
the list is endless yet we watch and do nothing about this problem
more aid is not only a humanitarian necessity but also an absolute condition for attaining stability and peace in the world
my group s first priority therefore is to bring this issue to an end at long last and to have it published in the official journal
an entirely different aspect is the varying development of the interest rates for government bonds
mr president i would like to start by welcoming mr maystadt warmly to this almost empty hall but i can assure him that even when we have the president of the european central bank visiting us by no means all delegates attend
and i believe that the commission presided over by a man of honour mr santer will keep its promises and make the necessary changes to a system of management that as we know is far from perfect
some types of funding can be threatened overnight as in the case of the banana crisis with the united states
it is also our responsibility to pursue a longterm policy
however we must still provide for protection of european intellectual property and repatriate to europe patents for inventions created in europe but currently kept in the united states
after all the international community of which we are one of the most important members should be united in such situations and should support the fight for respect for human rights together because solidarity is the key word in this debate
on that issue which is dear to your heart mr radwan and to that of other members of parliament i would say that our aspiration and it is really a work in progress was to maximise the benefits of european integration following the successful introduction of the euro since it is clear that the availability of a single settlement engine for securities denominated in euros would undoubtedly represent progress
by way of comparison there was a shortage of cod in the s followed by a huge surplus in the north sea in the seventies
their numbers have not only diminished as a result of illness or pollution of the sea water along denselypopulated coasts but also by the increasing hunt for them
there are also very good reasons for indicating in parliaments legislative resolution the importance of the principle of equality between men and women in order to guarantee a balanced representation of both sexes
turin is trying in fact to make cities the protagonists in building peace between nations
most of them have not ratified and they certainly have not implemented something we have called for in numerous parliamentary reports
its role as leader of the eurogroup should be strengthened in order better to reflect the significance of the euro in the international context as well
i should like to emphasize that i do however share your opinion about the contribution made by ngos and charitable activities to a wide variety of sectors because they represent decisive contributions to relieving many sufferings while enabling in certain cases whole swathes of societies in development to take their destiny into their own hands
the odds are then that their accession will with the benefit of hindsight be seen as a huge mistake and a failure
and it is true that progress has been made with rd but it is also true that progress in the financial contribution is taking place essentially in the public sector although the greatest differences in terms of investment in this type of activity arise in the private sector
the commissions assessment that the costs of enlargement might be covered by economic growth seem overoptimistic
illegal detention without charge or trial in guantanamo bay or iraq is bad enough but secret detention where people are kept incommunicado with no access to lawyers and at the mercy of mistreatment or torture is the blackest of black holes
thus whereas in the case of civil law several issues have been promoted in the case of criminal law things have remained almost at a standstill
if we were talking about budgetary aid i would have no hesitation whatsoever in accepting your proposal
this is also urged in the committee on agriculture and rural developments report
i must apologise for asking these two questions so abruptly but we want to see peace and we want to see justice
that however is eur billion or more than of the eus gdp
in one case in which i was concerned the commission official when questioned in committee said that the epas are not only about trade they are also about regional integration and exporting the eu model
the fact that this information campaign is being made with the support of ngos and via them will hopefully prevent a repeat of that
history proved him right when he predicted that the united kingdom after a long period of hesitation would put itself up for the ecsc and the eec once these two communities achieved their first successes without changing anything in their federal principles
the main activities which were proposed towards this end were reflected in the council resolution of june which encompasses points which were suggested by the commission in its report at that time
he knows and understands their problems which in this case relate directly to road safety and concern us all
other european innovation partnerships could be proposed later
what have we got so far
it will be an effort that should first of all give us precise information on the contribution that each source can make
it could do nothing else
we actually have the necessary legal instruments to achieve this the charter proclaimed at nice but also article of the eu treaty which refers to the european convention on human rights and the constitutional tradition common to the member states together with article of that treaty which will be further strengthened by the nice treaty when it enters into force
firstly i refer to what mr maccormick said right at the beginning of this debate which was also repeated by other speakers
we will have to keep an eye on what the member states do with this and how this ban is handled under no circumstances must we end up with a situation in which content is determined by the product advertised
better preparation increases our chance of successfully influencing the un commission
the fact is that consumers are entitled to certain basic information for example what am i buying what is it made of and where does it come from
i personally would therefore support mrs nieblers new proposal in which she suggests establishing a callback procedure in the wake of lamfalussy
with regard to the aid system in our view the extreme variability of socioeconomic and environmental conditions suggests that we should make the decoupled percentage flexible starting from a minimum of in any case
consequently the commission considers that the necessary instruments as concerns judicial cooperation in civil matters including the family law area are already in place to reach the objectives the members refer to
president barroso spoke with vigour on march and reminded president putin of our wellknown position on democratisation but also warned that we would not accept violence on election day
i should first and foremost like to thank mr sacconi for his extremely patient work but also the commission and the presidency which are unfortunately not represented in the chamber
at the same time peoples aspirations for more freedom and greater participation in decisionmaking have grown fuelled by rising incomes education and information flows
the decision will be taken on may by the heads of state and of government
i voted for this report because this is an appropriate time to review the education and training objectives that were laid down in the lisbon strategy and to evaluate what was unsuccessful in this area
mr president i am not in a position to express such a forthright opinion as some members have done
mr president there is a very unpleasant use of cranes for public hangings especially hangings including torture
furthermore i believe that public understanding of economic issues must be improved
perhaps by looking at the causes of this situation rather than fixing on the present we will have a fairer and more objective view of the partial responsibility of the belgrade government particularly with regard to what happened to it subsequently due to its actions in kosovo
the cologne helsinki and lisbon councils have all made significant contributions in that regard
we welcome the commissions assistance for recovery in the northern caucasus
perhaps you could say what you want to say personally to mrs green
at the moment the european union is playing with the future of many farmers and stockbreeders
in the joint declaration on communicating europe to which this report relates mention is also made of several different eu programmes such as plan d and citizens for europe of which junilistan is fiercely critical
i am supportive of the principle of turkish accession but recognise that it will be a long hard road
not only is it a fundamental principle it is also the first at least in order of time among the principles of equality
this is clearly a matter of a concealed reserve which indeed contravenes the financial regulation
as regards income working and recruitment conditions and access to employment the situation of women seems to be deteriorating more quickly than that of men
what began as a simple pact among a half a dozen nations to create a common market for coal and steel grew into an economic and political powerhouse
that is an important point and in two respects on the one hand and this is where i am behind mr clarke that we must not be squeamish
if we were to have a onesided commission in the year at the beginning of agenda that would not be a good start and it could lead to a conflict with the european parliament at least with my group
in the light of this i am obliged to vote against the report drawn up by mr rocard
that has been criticised by some members of this chamber because it provides funds for the president of tunisias justice system
therefore we have also invited representatives of the candidate countries to a number of different meetings and seminars during our presidency
although we agree that the treaty of nice does not constitute a foundation for the future and this is why we voted against we object to attempts at following the path of deeper neoliberalism federalism and militarism
there are contradictory scientific statements and many people are afraid of the possible dangers and risks
i have had the opportunity to do so in three different countries
calls for more industrialisation more development of the private sector and more investment in the knowledge economy are getting louder and louder
so what has happened to this muchvaunted autonomy to organise their own public services
yes there is a road that leads to europe and there is also a road that leads to the european union for turkey and the same rules apply to turkey as apply to latvia bratislava and slovenia
through this motion for a resolution we welcome the european unions initiatives to combat tuberculosis in the poorest countries but we call for more scientific research to be undertaken to develop new drugs and new vaccines against this disease
the presidency must do something
resolution of the conflict
at the same time the european parliament turns a blind eye to decades of subversive activity by the usa and the criminal embargo
thirdly we should call on the un security council to boost the mandate and resources of unamig to progressively establish truly independent international peacekeeping forces
therefore the countries of central and eastern europe need
concerns are being expressed not only about the lack of results in the economic field but also about the lack of progress in combating discrimination
price stability is the task cause and objective of the european central banks policy
the fight against terrorism must of course also respect constitutional criteria otherwise it cannot be justified
much has been said since seattle about the procedural and organisational shortcomings of the wto
i would also like to endorse what mr winkler said and respond by adding a slightly different slant namely that better regulation does not always mean fewer rules and regulations or deregulation but rather more effective regulation that is mainly geared towards the outcome and end result
there is no need for us either to defend or accuse
but in my opinion the rapporteur should see at the end what the result is and if the result is good he should simply refer it back to the commission
it had been hoped that the sinks would not have been so important
in recent years ukraine has turned into a political football pitch it must not be forced to choose between russia and the west
in the context of the treaty of lisbon this is a highly justified demand
implementing sound sustainable charging policies is therefore absolutely necessary and they must be acceptable to the population
i hope that the honourable members particularly the socialist group in the european parliament understand this message
first it is equally if not more important to work together to prevent terrorism by which i mean addressing its root causes
that is as i say all well and good
i assure you that the commission will not hesitate to intervene if and when needed
it does not work
this is something that mediterranean courteousness would normally always demand but in this specific case both rapporteurs have really earned these thanks
despite his scepticism i hope that will be achieved
yet all the decisions about the protection of humanitarian aid goods and staff despite the fact that defence implications are specifically excluded as well as all actions taken directly by the commission and by the specialized member state organizations will now be referred to and controlled by the council under its excessive a procedure
we are prohibiting the recycling of animal carcasses and condemned animal byproducts into the food chain we are banning animal cannibalism this is a positive step
i therefore abstained from voting on the approval
by adopting my report parliament had already called for the amendment of that directive the wording of which was too timid even though the council of ministers had not even endorsed the more ambitious european commission proposal of
i do not want to use stronger words
given the major internal challenges faced by the union and its citizens and bearing in mind its enhanced international character we realise that the main objective of its policy must be to reduce the existing social economic and territorial inequalities
to this end this services directive is not just a necessary instrument but also an essential one
the statistics show that the programme only alleviates the problem of malnutrition but is not eliminating it
turning to the cunha report may i firstly place on record as mr fischler and mr varela suanzescarpegna have done before me the great appreciation of the members of the fisheries committee and indeed of most if not all of the members of this house for the work undertaken by mr cunha during his term of office as an mep representing portugal
third the reforms undertaken by national central banks to adapt their structures to the new institutional framework are paramount to reversing our current downward trend
i hope the council will then recognise that parliament has equal rights and finally accord it more powers and the right of initiative
first and foremost one thinks of illegal immigration
however i think it would be useful to look more towards tax reliefs and less towards aid measures
for example in countries like bulgaria exports for the first months of last year fell by a whole compared to the previous year and imports by
that it did not explode was thanks to this extremist mr xhaferi that it still has not exploded is thanks once again first and foremost to mr xhaferi and certainly not to our action to the action of the european union
the constitutional court has upheld the ban on the communist party
the commission is aware of the negative social and health consequences that these problems might have on affected individuals or families raising children affected by dysrelated problems
this structure is as follows a programme on integrating and strengthening the european research area which brings together all the activities involving research and coordination of research policies in europe a programme on structuring the european research area which covers activities involving the integration of research and innovation the mobility of researchers and infrastructures and issues relating to science and society and the links between science and the public all increasingly burning issues within european society we also have a programme covering euratom research activities and then two programmes covering the activities of the joint research centre in the nonnuclear and nuclear fields respectively
people are ready to demonstrate in the street
large sums are at present used for these export refunds
at the same time however i think that the telecommunications package as a whole is still something of a hotchpotch that it falls short of the mark and that we need clarity about which areas it applies to and those which it does not apply to
the compromise resolution before us is a perfect expression of this notion
rapporteur thank you very much mr president
indeed of what use is europe if not to support member states in need
everything indicates that the draft constitution would have been rejected in germany too if there had been a referendum there
indeed they take into consideration important topics on which my fellow members have focused and which have been examined in the relevant parliamentary committee and debated here in this chamber

madam president commissioner mr lopez garrido with the analysis of passenger name record data as with swift an attempt is being made to reconcile the fight against global terrorism and serious crime with the fundamental rights of all to the protection of privacy and information selfdetermination
on the pretext that it is necessary to adapt the institutions to the prospect of enlargement it is now being suggested that there should be a disproportionate strengthening at various levels of the decisionmaking powers of the large countries and an intolerable reduction of the decisionmaking powers of the small and mediumsized countries all this suggests and implicitly encourages the creation of political inner cabinets which are totally unacceptable and which will make it easier to achieve enhanced cooperation
we now know that we may have two options either indirectly by improving the prerogatives of each national parliament in each of the member states or directly by introducing new procedures to enable the national parliaments to intervene more directly in the european decisionmaking process
mr president commissioner it seems to me that a great deal has happened since the commission first began work on its initiative nearly a year ago
the intergovernmental model is out of date
i think that this evening in this plenary debate we are also making a contribution to doing this and i think and hope that good progress will be made so that we will have a second directive to combat money laundering in the european union very soon which will then i hope also be swiftly implemented by the member states
i agreed with this report which calls for measures to be taken and resources to be provided to ensure that eu funds are not subject to corruption and also to ensure onestop transparency of the beneficiaries of eu funds
it is very important that a report such as this one has been produced and that we should also aim to consider companies in remote areas in the north for them to be able to compete on an equal footing with other european companies
the greatness of premier imre nagy lies in the fact that he recognised that
this also strengthens the autonomous ability of the european union to respond to international crises work to which mr von wogau has devoted himself in particular in the subcommittee on security and defence
every party involved in marine transport must be made to accept responsibility
i believe that this might encourage a number of distribution and supply undertakings to take steps in line with the commissions thinking
we are also examining how best the enlargement candidate countries can be brought into the network
there has been a conflict of interests in these places between russia iran and turkey throughout this period
opportune and critical analyses are made of dci and the eus development cooperation policy which we consider fair and necessary
indeed as i said when i last addressed parliament they will also have negative consequences for the european union a point which two speakers suggested late in this debate

this is something we owe to our turkish neighbours and we must tell the turks that they are well on the way and that they should continue along the path upon which they have embarked for the benefit of turkey the eu and stability and growth in our part of the world
mr katiforis has certainly not lacked the courage to set out the measures which in his opinion could help to improve and conserve the natural resources of the sea
mr president in our report on the euromediterranean market we confirmed that we recommend maintaining and developing the basic infrastructures which make an economy a single and cohesive economy and it is interesting that now with the economic crisis the present economic situation illustrates quite clearly that there are cohesion and common denominators in the south
however and this is also an issue now we need to check whether it has really worked well enough in the current situation
hardest hit at the moment is the airline industry but we must not forget the tourist industry which has already suffered greatly this year from footandmouth disease
we call on the government of azerbaijan and in particular president aliyev to proceed quickly with the necessary electoral reforms and to show the necessary respect for its citizens right to free fair and democratic elections
the united states made the dollar a single currency but it preceded that with political union with the declaration of independence bismarck created the gold mark after first unifying the german states politically the monetary laws followed
i see it as an artificial exercise to seek to issue identical prescriptions to countries with extremely diverse legal traditions and environmental circumstances
and there is the commissioners proposal to leave them out of this initiative
the commissioner named a new member state that has not yet announced a date
vicepresident of the commissionhigh representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy mr president first of all what is very clear to me in listening to this debate is the significance of our call for a credible inquiry
that leads to a conflict of interest in the fight against fraud
patients prefer to be cared for well close to home and in their families
madam president ladies and gentlemen the principal demands on foreign trade have been laid down in several resolutions of the european parliament the object being to bolster the links between foreign and security policy foreign trade policy and development and cooperation
i think the uk has shown that
these are of course sweeping reforms and critical support on the part of parliament is essential if they are to be implemented
that does not of course detract from the fact that if you say you want to abandon national quotas each one of us as we are here today would like to see some geographical balance in it all
european foreign policy should complement and generate synergies with immigration policy focusing on the causes of instability and structural problems in the countries of origin
both nice and the social agenda agreed at that meeting highlight the need to count on the workers in management changes and combine the security and flexibility of economic growth with labour relations and the consequences for the social environment
as the only directly elected body in the european union the european parliament is in my opinion at a kind of turning point
the objective that we share that every child should learn to speak at least two languages apart from their mother tongue can be assessed

therefore the european commission must speed up its reform process in this area and step up its control and monitoring of noncompliant states and parliament without allowing there to be tension between its head and its heart must summon up the courage with the resolution before us today to take up arms and wage ideological war against the egoism and evil ways of mankind and without jeopardising scientific research confirm our unquestionable duty to respect defenceless animals
the second worst culprit was sweden
political union is making very slow progress
this situation calls for particular consideration of how determined we are as you mentioned in the report to encourage consensus between parliament and the council from the firstreading stage within the codecision procedure
mr president each village and town in england has a line around it for planning purposes stating that it is a defined village or town settlement
but we also need to have some measure of trust because without trust everything falls apart so as it were we need to have confidence in the political struggle and in the objectives of the political struggle that we are pursuing
unfortunately this amendment was not adopted
the report commissioned for the june conference warned that the international financial system has become a money launderers dream processing a large part of the estimated billion worth of drugs money every year
firstly i never mentioned my father as was indicated in the transcript that president klaus released
i have several things to say on this point
i am convinced that all countries including slovakia will soon agree upon the strict security requirements involved in temporarily deploying an enhanced version of the current system as proposed by portugal
they told me that the best you can do is to speak greek they will listen to you but the debate will take place in russian and english which means that i would not understand anything because i am not as fortunate as you in knowing all these languages
after all it was not created for the politicians or for international organisations but for particular states
that too is natural
it will never work without legal immigration options
therefore each time we do something that does not help to strengthen the rule of law anywhere we are contributing to the aim of the terrorists which is precisely to destabilise the rule of law
the fact is that mr michel raymond has been convicted now that the french supreme court of appeal has handed down its final judgment of fraud relating to the european union budget
the texts do not matter
according to it the activity of the community should include a contribution to supporting services which are oriented to the common good
the first concerns the method i consider it of vital importance that power over the treaties lies with the national parliaments
nobody could then seriously foresee that these european communities would grow into an overarching cooperative of or more european states
however there is plenty more scope for improvement in every country
the commission should really be asking for member states to be supported and not obstructed here in their aims to keep the air clean
there are quite a lot of irish vehicles locked with perishable goods mostly lamb and beef in refrigerated trucks which now for twelve to fourteen days have been surviving on a small amount of diesel to keep the refrigerators going
it is to be welcomed that the councils common position meets the main demands from the first reading in parliament
on behalf of the house i express once more our support for the respective authorities in their efforts in the fight against terrorism
i think that on this basis there will be considerable movement particularly in belgrade
and in principle those problems are being investigated and resolved
as is mentioned in the reports we need a new architecture to protect this relationship to protect it from external storms and to make it much more solid than it is now
this possibility however is not currently part of the conventions plans which are still mainly along the lines of the united model
certainly not when all the warnings have been taken no account of when commissioners are proposed whom the first wise men s report has cast considerable suspicion upon and when following the conversation i mentioned no critical questions are asked of mr lamy in the course of the committee s oral hearing
we know that past governments did not treat these negotiations seriously but the current government does and it is making major efforts to catch up as baroness nicholson herself has admitted
i think you are kidding
greece has adopted an ambitious programme to correct its deficit and to reform its public administration and its economy
we play a part in that and in nothing else
i too am a dissenting member of the committee on constitutional affairs on the constitution
there is still much to be done for senior citizens
read the text
furthermore the authorities in member states must be aware of the risks involved in national implementation
mr president i wish to emphasise the importance of the european union providing leadership not merely immediate emergency humanitarian aid but also longterm cooperation for rebuilding the country
am i really the most appropriate target for mr von boettichers words
the post of high representative is a product of the lisbon treaty
mr president we are going to vote in favour of this report because as it was drafted in the committee on research technological development and energy it is perfectly in order
i think that europe can make has already made development the most tangible demonstration of its values and that is why i am resolutely optimistic
we say that our success rests on dialogue and the european mediterranean process should be exemplified by a successful university
incidentally the cuban situation is a telling example of what can happen the united states have maintained a stubborn embargo against cuba for years
you are right
none of the other available instruments takes effect so quickly
we have problems with evaluation
european environmental legislation must be complied with
you know that of course
we should bear in mind that combating unemployment is a priority not only of the individual member states but also of the union as a whole
for all these reasons i voted in favour of the langen report and i now await the commission s response to our requests and demands
then we shall be able to say that justice really is the same throughout the eu
i hope that this intervention can be included tomorrow by means of oral amendments
this minutes silence had two meanings firstly solidarity with the victims of the catastrophe which struck madeira and their families and secondly a tribute to all the workers who have been tirelessly providing assistance to those victims
parliament and the council will be kept fully informed of the selection procedure and the outcome
our main aim should be to give the regions themselves that is to say their inhabitants and their businesses the capacity to exploit the possibilities of the information society in order to strengthen the competitiveness of the economy particularly as far as small and mediumsized enterprises are concerned and to promote regional development
i will therefore only say a few words in support of the approach proposed by mrs van lancker
we are however ready to consider flexible mechanisms in order to enable them to apply the plan without it being too much of a burden
let me say something on that subject
the institutions of this unique model the institutions of the european union have played a fundamental role in this process and it is amazing to see and this is one of the things which has made the greatest impression on me since i have been here in brussels the extent to which the people who work in the institutions view their jobs as completely different from any other job there is an unmistakable atmosphere of being part of the historic project of european integration
that is why i am pleased mr duisenberg that you have today promised once again that we will get inflation forecasts and that progress will be made with publishing the econometric models
there is a tremendous negative attitude in the united kingdom the state to which i reluctantly belong
mrs redings report is a really good one if i may say so
the accession of the ten new countries hailing from the former soviet bloc and yugoslavia the baltics and the mediterranean is undoubtedly the most significant and historic event in the history of the union
the european parliament has clearly expressed its support for the aspirations of ukraine and moldova to become candidates for membership of the european union
the convention should make those values known to the people whom they concern and it should set up joint institutions that can guarantee them
that is the emergency you cannot declare a roma emergency when no such emergency exists
with regard to various comments which were rightly made by the rapporteur mrs leperreverrier i would say that i understand the proposal she has made to set up a kind of steering committee but that we feel that perhaps it may not be necessary to do this
but we must also make it very clear that if we support this measure here today we are not giving the commission or the council a free rein
we must take action to ensure respect for the arms embargo the un security council must impose sanctions travel restrictions a ban on financial services etcetera on individuals who have participated in the pillaging of congolese assets the eu and its member states must act against companies involved in exploitation we need a peacekeeping force in the east of the country and action must be taken to disarm all illegally armed groups
here we need to proceed realistically and be ambitious
in writing including selfemployed drivers in the working time directive is a prime example of how to make the situation worse regarding people who have little enough confidence in the eu as it is
that brings me to the origins of the crisis we are going through
the need for true european integration and international coordination has been brought into focus more than ever both in words and deeds
at eur billion the volume of expenditure has been increased by hardly of the figure moreover the budget related solely to the europe of
on this subject i should like to express my pleasure with the agreement reached in the council on four draft directives which will have a decisive effect on improving the stability of the financial sector protecting individuals and further strengthening the internal market
they are pinning their hopes on us because they have nobody else to turn to
this is the point i would like to return to once again i believe that this is a very serious issue
it is important that sports organisations and clubs know their responsibilities
mr president as i am sure you are aware for you listen avidly to all my explanations of vote i was born in genoa a coastal city and i have worked as a sailor in the past
we expect the commission to behave like a key player in the examination of the sort of society we need to build
on the one hand they wanted to pay in less at the same time they turned a blind eye to the agricultural policy and its share in expenditure of of our budget and then the foreign minister said we want to enlarge eastward
present trends in mutual relations reveal that a certain view of belarus has taken hold among the political circles of the european union and that view is very critical and onesided
the construction of european citizenship will come about as a result of the involvement of individuals not only of institutions
as has already been said they are not cooperating with the un international commission for crimes against humanity and they are also committing crimes and atrocities in aceh and west papua
it seems to me that the european parliament is a body which should call particularly strongly for the right of the tibetans to preserve their identity
let us remember that hundreds of thousands of people are still living in temporary camps and over thousand people have died of cholera
if we are supplying food to of the population of gaza we have a right to see where european taxpayers money is being spent whether it is being used appropriately and whether it is reaching the people who need it
what political conclusions does the council intend to draw from burmas admittance to asean
we do a lot but it achieves nothing
the nigerian military junta thinks that this knowledge and the possession of oil reserves means that it can do as it pleases and we have to admit that this arrogant attitude is paying off since world protest is loud but nothing is done
that in itself will go a long way to improving flow control
the time has now come to go forward together
one of the issues that will make sense for you when you are making up your minds is that of the balanced reporting requirements as i said in my opening remarks these will no longer apply to the written press or to ondemand audiovisual media services
the relationship covers many areas and it is bound to succeed
cultural industries in europe
i am pleased to note that this is the position of both the commission and the council which have also proved willing to achieve compromise solutions that go some way towards meeting some of the more reasonable demands of telecommunications undertakings
on behalf of the uen group mr president freedom of movement work and residence throughout the european union are some of the most important benefits gained by our citizens
equally on the balancing side consumers expect that their existing rights to be able make private copies to be able to use library facilities to be able if they are disadvantaged if they are blind or disabled to have access to new forms of media will be safeguarded
it is particularly important to carry out this diplomatic and information activity with the socalled group of comprising the acp the african union and ldcs
thank you mr karlsson
i do not think that it is helpful to try to accuse the council of favouring one side over the other
this inquiry must not be confined to the management of sensus
pursuant to the principles of better lawmaking a proper impact assessment and the principle of optimising costs and benefits should always be taken into account when creating a competitive legal environment for the car industry
i also voted in favour because i am convinced that this assistance complements the redundancy aid provided for in all national legislation and collective agreements
what we are trying to do of course because we have a large number of members in the security council is everything we can to foster a joint approach to the problem
earthquakes in central italy
you will be aware that of the centralised projects are open to these young people
where member states are willing to take steps in the direction for example of joint activities with regard to national coastguard services concerning questions on the environment questions with regard to fisheries questions with regard to illegal immigration questions concerning drug trafficking and trafficking of human beings then in those instances i think that there is a lot of scope for having a system of national coastguards coordinated in a more effective and efficient way by for example sharing the assets that different member states enjoy by exchanging data and by creating necessary tools including for example sea mapping which could be an asset for coastguard and other activities
many of the amendments from the committee on employment and social affairs have been taken into account by the sixpack rapporteurs
the eus responsibility in this respect is crushing
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen this excellent report by our colleague mr vakalis links in seamlessly to the three reports on natural disasters adopted by parliament last year and is an important addition to them for these previous reports did not deal with the issue of earthquakes
therefore there has not been a lot of time or opportunity for assessment of the general political effect of the expansion and its impact on relationships between the member states of the european union which apply the schengen rules and the neighbouring countries
there is a majority of countries out of the total of in the international community who are in favour of a universal moratorium and the treaties that have been adopted and the constitutional changes that have been made by many countries show that it is not simply a theoretical majority
similarly it is vital that regional tv should be involved
i am pleased to report that on december the competitiveness council showed a keen interest in the key elements of the reform
if there is to be stability in the country the homes destroyed during the war must be rebuilt as soon as possible the health system must be made efficient and functional since there is a shortage of medical staff and paramedics and hospitals need immediate repair work with logistical support
remember this is the president who thinks he can provide world leadership
mr stockton thank you very much for your kind remarks concerning the importance of the acting president but i must say i have a shotgun in my house and this will be quite enough
the reply went on eur banknotes are widely used for hoarding purposes surprise surprise
legislation is not always the answer each case must be examined and considered carefully and the competitiveness and sustainability of each sector must be closely watched
for this reason president barroso i would ask you the following question will you press for uniform mandatory european standards and will you finally ensure that the eu environmental standards in particular the environmental impact assessments are implemented correctly and that sanctions are taken against those who break the rules
in a country such as mine spain which is going through a demographic crisis that if possible is more serious than the average in the european union this type of communication from the commission and this type of debate are very helpful because this is a deeprooted structural problem rather than a shortterm situation and these things take the problem out of the national political debate and make it much broader with greater capacity for analysis and response
the decisive nature of the report makes it difficult to explain why a real restriction has been created in regulating this right to access documents even though the restriction relates only to confidential documents
launching europe through economics through coal and steel through trade was a stroke of genius by the founding fathers
during a visit by the troika to the united states on and april which i think the commissioner may speak about agreement was reached to explore ways of relaunching the euus highlevel groups activities in order to examine policies for fighting climate change
the members of the troika mission also supported this
let me say a few words on the background to this very complex issue
in writing the human rights situation in cambodia is an ever growing concern
we are cheering on our slovenian friends so that they have a successful presidency
i will end by mentioning that within the framework of enlargement it will be necessary for future member states to conform to all community regulations including environmental restrictions
for the planet that might mean reducing the tensions that lie at the root of many conflicts
mr president much has been said in this house about the fact that nowadays economies are increasingly globalised and competitive
we are going to continue to ensure that there are additional requirements upon dangerous or hazardous waste disposal because it poses risks over and above that posed by municipal waste in terms of handling and other controls
once again the national perspective of the member states has resulted in a fragmented decision with no clear criteria regarding the use of three languages
it also includes areas such as disaster control energy and the environment
for this reason we will reformulate the reference to the various sectors that are covered by the studies in article paragraph a
measures should include forfeiture of licence from suppliers and distributors of counterfeit medicine maximum fines and criminal responsibility for all people related to illegal activity in the area of medicine trading
i do not think it is necessary to draw attention to the gender of members who speak on issues in this parliament
what do we have to do to make it more competitive
this provision is to be deplored
we must persuade the council of ministers to do likewise
i hope mr president that when the euromed parliamentary assembly over which you preside meets in brussels in a few days time we will hear a statement from the commission and the council on precisely what happened why it happened when it happened and who took the orders
having said that the military action was not a decision of the european union as such
as the time allowed has elapsed i shall now suspend the debate
we do not want to see the consumer alone bear the risks inherent in technical progress
if i had forced her she would probably not have seen the added value we have now and the idea would therefore not have lasted this long
we very much regret that not even amendment no on greening the administration of the eu institutions was adopted
if animals are being transported over long distances from poland to italy or from lithuania to italy for example of course the consumer pays
secondly the objectivity which the european parliament must display in this matter leads me to point out that in real terms the community price has been in a steady decline for around fifteen years
if the directive is passed there are serious implications for our access to food and medicine
however there also needs to be european added value in the response
so our optimism that we would make headway there was not misplaced
it is not always easy but it is an effort worth making
if we had a sensible set of rules we could rid the trading system of an enormous additional burden
at the risk of repeating myself as regards access by relatives to prisoners the honourable member well knows that the position is that all states have an exclusive and unqualified right to decide on entry to their territory by nonnationals
in the quotation i included at the start of my document i quoted a great european contemporary historian tony judt who lectures at new york university
the goal is to make a difference worldwide with technical innovations
mr president on behalf of the socialist group i would like to welcome the reports of mrs hautala hulthen and pollack all of which make an important contribution to improving air quality and protecting human health in the environment within europe
korea is a serious market
sweden the united kingdom and finland as front runners of the open market as well as germany and the netherlands which have gone a long way in that direction all see the final deadline as a victory for protectionism
surely noone could challenge the need for information
what we demand in this report is firstly a stronger commitment in terms of military presence because without that we shall get nowhere secondly a steppingup of the commitment to improve democratic structures in the new republic of afghanistan which has fallen into a situation of total lawlessness over the past or more years and worst of all lies at the heart of international terrorism
mr milosevics language is the language of force
it is high time the european union supported them by clearly identifying sharon as the main obstacle to peace by specifically entering into official talks with those opposed to this policy of adopting the worst possible line notably the pioneers of the geneva accord by officially requesting the immediate deployment of an international force to protect the population of the palestinian territories and by suspending the agreement with israel as demanded by our parliament two years ago
i am also in favour of including small and mediumsized enterprises in statistics of this kind
on the contrary they underline the necessity of finding a peaceful solution
i believe this cannot be conducive to democracy and so this is a vitally important area of concern
who is actually destroying the europe that has been successfully achieved
i share too the objective raised by a number of honourable members on the question of capital punishment
there is a piece of old and practical wisdom which says better is the enemy of good enough
furthermore i entirely agree with the amendment tabled by mr metten
we in the socialist group in the european parliament will lay great stress on this
the worst off are the casteless dalits whose rights the authorities do not monitor closely enough
let us therefore take great care with work in a closed environment
these are exciting times for turkey and for europe and many exciting years will follow years in which turkey will need to improve a great deal in the areas of human rights womens rights freedom for trade unions and freedom of religion
staff of the european community and member states of the european union have signed an agreement to fight corruption they did so at the meeting of the justice and internal affairs council
not only did we agree not only did we propose it but we also reinforced it
with rail packages instead of modernising railways in europe and giving them the resources for their ambitions we have disorganised this means of transport in order to launch it into foolish competition with air transport and unfair and unequal competition with road transport to the detriment of the coherence of networks and the development of local services
firstly international aspects the commission works in directions such as making every possible effort to strengthen international cooperation with third countries by encouraging states to join the safety assessment of a foreign aircraft programme which encompasses all the states in europe but also through technical assistance projects to achieve the worldwide standards
the rapporteurs work in close cooperation with the commission and the council will allow i hope this text to be approved at first reading
industry and organisations should work together with governments as mrs martens and others of our fellowmembers have just emphasised
the mutual assistance clause specifically states that it will not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states which guarantees that neutrality will be maintained
let us ensure that our resolve does not falter and thereby weaken theirs
we are going to try and introduce a performancebased approach by the first half of
in their subsequent contributions to this debate members of my group will be commenting on the individual components of the proposal
mr president ladies and gentlemen i should like to congratulate mr duchon on his brilliant report
what risks and problems can be seen
it was my impression at this meeting that in common with ourselves mr slater is of the opinion that the hushkits are an issue of secondary importance which stands in the way of far more important issues and that we must put this matter to bed as swiftly as possible
i would like to appeal to all groups in this house to lend their support to the package of amendments now proposed and let us from thursday onward ensure that we transcend partisanship if some perceive it to have existed
we see many children working in conditions of slavery and forced labour and we would urge all european union states to ratify the ilo convention dealing with these issues
my question is how is cooperation being organised on these issues within the european commission between for example the commissioner for development and humanitarian aid and the commissioner for employment and social affairs
in writing we have reached a critical period for the economic partnership agreements
in this respect its seems to me important that these plans strengthen in each case the study of the local conditions in which the concentrations are produced in order thereby to combat them more effectively
i would then like to stress the importance of item which calls for the broadcasting on the internet of audiovisual recordings of parliaments plenary sittings and for the creation of archives
in this way we could also help improve transparency of cost in the internal market in electricity
i am very pleased that we have finally got a female trade commissioner and the first female british commissioner
the loss of purchasing power that has hit ordinary people in the european union compounded by the drastic increases in energy prices is a veritable impoverishment programme
we expect the commission to come up with its own proposal for increasing gas reserves within the european union which is very important and for developing an interconnection system between member states with a higher capacity which is also a very important element in guaranteeing security both for citizens and for business in the european union
i would like to stress once again that the european parliament was calling for the coordination of policies long before the maastricht treaty existed as a means of genuinely achieving european added value
i would suggest that there has clearly been a misunderstanding
as far as efficiency factors are concerned our position is that authorisation should be sciencebased but of course once the authorities of the member states decide which medicines they reimburse by public funds they can reinforce that by different studies of their efficiency and that is supported also by g
up to of the sums paid out may be used to assist public authorities in preparing the projects which will be selected partly on the basis of geographical balance
this process these rulings are no simple matter commissioner and cannot be decided under the comitology procedure or in the standing committee and technical annex they need further debate and another vote with codecision by parliament
we voted in favour of this resolution on forced prostitution which recognises the reality of the situation in germany and the need to take the opportunity presented by the world cup to condemn the trafficking of human beings and prostitution we have always maintained however that forced prostitution is not the right term to use as it suggests that there is such a thing as voluntary prostitution
recent repression of demonstrations in russia
does the council presidency consider that a strategic partnership between the eu and russia is compatible with the european values of democracy human rights and the rule of law which russia does not respect as the following examples indicate the violation of freedom of the press restrictions on civil society through the ngo law human rights violations in chechnya and the conditions of detention of platon lebedev and mikhail khodorkovsky
we should not be surprised if the various situations in the balkans worsen politically and then degenerate into civil war
someone writing that the united states is a rogue state an axis of evil that must be combated
we have the problem that aceh is an ancient historic sultanate which has had a significant cultural influence on the region
the commission completely agrees with the proposals made by the triparliamentary mission
crossborder and interregional cooperation
of course i have no objections to other countries adopting measures which match ours
many in the european parliament rightly speak of the hostages of unemployment
unfortunately the brok report is permeated by traditional overconfidence in military interventions as the only way of bringing about peace
hence the proposal that this framework programme should operate in the period to following which it must be renewed in accordance with the new financial perspective
i welcome the fact that the different consumer associations in europe will be vigilant during the changeover period so as to ensure that the interests of consumers are protected during the timescale of the euro changeover
in any event i think this is an interesting report and i shall be voting for it
these are all existing measures and if we add the soil protection directive to them it will create regulatory duplication parallel legislation that really only creates more bureaucracy
i want to make it quite clear and i know from conversations i have had with members from the accession countries that for all of us the european budget is important
now while i am not sure whether the term justification is adequate here and personally i think that in french it would have been preferable to use the term praise or apologia for terrorism and whether it would not have been better to change it i will be interested to see how this house reacts tomorrow to this somewhat delicate point which goes to the very heart of the debate namely where to draw the line between security fundamental rights and freedom of expression
none of these challenges can be faced by our countries acting alone
mr president you spoke of a realistic and intelligent defence of the prerogatives of this house you mentioned the lamfalussy report also yesterday you decided not to attend the court of justice and to adopt a longsighted approach on a matter vital to europe s citizens
these conclusions pave the way for a new consensus on enlargement in the european union
it is unacceptable that we have no clear rules for replacing dangerous substances with less dangerous ones
our initiative on patient safety and healthcareassociated infections fully respects the member states competence to finance structure and deliver health services as they see fit
they also have a positive impact on the purchase of goods and services
political agreement was reached on the draft regulation establishing the european institute for gender equality and conclusions on the review of the implementation by the member states and the eu institutions of the beijing platform for action and on womens health have been adopted
the european council will therefore stress the key role of the eu at international conferences and its commitments
mr president the challenge of the hong kong conference lays down the boundaries of the credibility operational acceptance and dynamism of the wto
i know that today you are planning to give us the broad outlines of these issues especially the ambitious project of european constitution mr president i am very grateful to you for having come along to speak to the european parliament
the reform is essential
i would emphasize once again perhaps unnecessarily that any arrangement that limits reciprocal exchange rates is always better than no arrangement at all and we should therefore follow the recommendations put forward by mr gasoliba i bohm and mr von wogau
a diploma supplement attached to a higher education diploma to help third parties to understand the meaning of that diploma
the socalled foreign minister a mr osman ferzaouli who resides in denmark as a political refugee says this will result in basayev being more responsible in future
it is already there for member states to use if they want to help specific dairy farmers out of business
but even at this relatively late stage i would urge the dutch presidency to do everything possible to strengthen the text particularly with regard to the employment chapter and selective areas of qualified majority voting
in its contacts with the international monetary fund the world bank and its creditor governments the commission has always fought for this initiative based on wide criteria to be applied this initiative should have appropriate and suitable support for the heavily indebted poor countries who are struggling to apply economic reform hoping to stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty
this is not an alternative to strengthening and improving the rules at the wto
commissioner cigarette smuggling can be divided into three streams the funds the goods and finally the accompanying documentation
the next item is the report by mrs roure on behalf of the committee on citizens freedoms and rights justice and home affairs on the proposal from the commission with regard to the adoption of a council directive c on the conditions of entry and residence of thirdcountry nationals for the purpose of study vocational training or voluntary service
i say that because freedom house has recently published a study in which the countries of the world are divided into three categories of press freedom free partly free and not free
that will depend in part on your vigilance but also on us
this is of course unacceptable
this policy has had particularly negative effects on coastal and smallscale fisheries which show reduced levels of production and employment as well as a reduction in their share of the total fish market to the benefit of largescale fishing industries
it is not the opinion of the commission that the patent period needs to be amended
indeed by accepting the principle of patents in this field when computerimplemented inventions are already protected by copyright multinationals are in effect given the power to seal off this sector
mr president in relation to the minutes has any progress been made by yourself and your offices in the matter of correspondence with a member of this house who made charges of a serious criminal nature in respect of the buildings policy of the institution
rejection of these initiatives would probably be a bad sign for change in the right direction
the results are currently being evaluated and we will table a proposal accordingly in at the latest
below is a selection of proposed cutbacks
mr president ladies and gentlemen i should like to inform minister alexander that today we are not talking about the fight against terrorism but about hundreds of flights throughout europe about kidnappings and torture carried out by the cia against european citizens or refugees and about torture practised in prisons on european soil
the cohesion funding should be a mechanism for stimulating economic growth across the eu but needs to have a specific goal as supporting smes and entrepreneurs who are the backbone of our economy
i think this is urgently required
on a subject as sensitive as drugs abuse where very different points of view exist not everybody could have their way
we certainly have sleepers within the eu who could become active at any time
it also seems right to support the bams with the aim of improving living standards for people in the acp countries which supply bananas and which are affected by the duties levied on bananas imported into the eu
the european union was and should remain the driving force for progress in the talks
at hampton court tomorrow the heads of state or government will discuss the challenges that globalisation poses to our economic and social models
it was adopted in and was due for transposition in the member states by the end of although quite a number of countries have yet to take the necessary steps
these groups are always protected by legislation which is lax from environmental commercial and fiscal points of view and gibraltar is no exception
in fact i think that the work done during the working sessions held so far has not always been satisfactory to the extent that no resolutions have been adopted on certain important topics
while i welcome the figured objectives that have been set i regret the hypocrisy of some of the provisions advocated by the pse and supported by the socialist and socialdemocratic governments
the petition claims that the united kingdom government has not properly applied the eu insurance directives
the scoreboard for more intensive cooperation in judicial matters decided on in tampere is really not a bad thing
we profoundly regret the current rejection and marginalisation of renewable energies and efficiency within the current programmes
the introduction of a packaging environment indicator was the main feature of this
in parallel the commission deals with anticompetitive behaviour as a priority
on behalf of the uen group mr president i should like to draw attention to two issues referred to in the report
six years on the eu still has a long way to go
the european parliaments report proposed an opportunity for an even lesser decoupling of support and we therefore chose to vote against that report
mrs maes there is no list at present but your request will be passed on and if any such thing appears you will be informed at once
reform of the market in wine again involves limiting production
that is why the liberalisation of this visa regime is urgently needed
in fact we are demanding compliance with the obligations before the luxembourg court
we want to look at how markets will evolve
there is no way we can justify a motorcycle with just one passenger emitting times as much pollution as a motor car with up to four passengers
mr president ladies and gentlemen it took four conciliation meetings for us to obtain this conclusion and this conciliation result which i think is a record
he also repudiates the basic forms of diplomatic politeness
an options paper will be issued in the coming days and it will be discussed by the antici group before a discussion in coreper ii coreper i will also feed into that process so i am grateful for the generous words of the honourable member
secondly there is still too little being done to provide small businesses with easier access to sources of finance
i belong to the catalan nation the language spoken by more than million people in other words more speakers than two of the current official languages of the european union and more speakers than six of the languages of the candidate states
however if the member states of the african union continue to support the dictator mugabe openly the question will arise as to what their own promises on democracy and human rights are actually worth
i think that we must take all these factors into account when assessing the situation and devise what other measures we need to take in relation to european solidarity and which are based on it
it is also vital to propose the insertion of a provision imposing an obligation to collect data regarding the accessibility of the tourist infrastructure to persons with reduced mobility
one of the main objectives of these provisions is to protect the rights of those who have subscribed to an insurance policy thereby making sure that the exercise of freedom to provide services is not to the detriment of consumer protection
in justice and home affairs we appreciate the fact that your presidency will focus on a series of measures strengthening the area of justice in the european union
this scandal must be brought to an end and i am confident that it will be brought to an end in the very near future
an important goal must be to harmonise company taxation
on the one hand we should avoid turning asylum seekers into political footballs between different countries because noone wants to take responsibility for dealing with their case
it has our full support
b by mr la malfa on behalf of the eldr group on the recent elections in armenia
there is only one way of preventing financial scandals

as for the point in the directive which refers to the type of waste the green list which according to the commission contains harmless substances many of which however are harmful to the environment and to public health i consider it very important to take account of the list included in the basel convention and incorporate it in the proposed regulation
parliaments call for stronger consumer protection and the fight against energy poverty is now enshrined in the legislative texts
in my view these are important points which can also be supported by technological development

madam that is what generally happens
even the european unions activities involving foreign policy policing security outside our borders and international cooperation are subject to the principles of the european convention on human rights

rapporteur mr president commissioner presidentinoffice of the council you just said that we are at the start of the budgetary process

i fully agree with this view

the commission is already contributing to this initiative but we also expect member states and industry to allocate resources

that is why we must act including for the least wealthy and quickly
i should like to thank the house for its tremendous effort
what is more the planned solutions to assist these protectorates are problematic and harmful
that is what the intensive security work carried out by the american secret services has so far achieved
to conclude i would like to state that the diversity that exists within the european union is positive however it is this same diversity that requires flexibility
parliaments position in relation to the council is indeed much more balanced as a result and parliament in particular as the legislator of first instance on a proposal from the commission can offer the council an immediately adoptable legislative product
for this reason there should be differentiated integration and this is what is essentially new about the amsterdam treaty within the institutional framework of the european union
although i cannot be very optimistic there are not enough positive indications that the political process under un supervision will bring concrete results in the foreseeable future for that it must be said that it has increased the prospect that for example the dialogue on security and the military situation on the island which is being conducted in the form of confidential diplomacy by the united nations will have a greater chance of success
if it does that would seriously undermine the political message of the dublin system
so mr rubig should get his facts right before he intervenes
several neighbouring countries such as chad the central african republic and uganda and even countries further afield such as somalia and the republic of congo could be forced to suffer the effects of this
simplified treaty reform or reforming treaty modified or modifying treaty the name matters little
nor indeed can i imagine any other danish members being able to vote in favour of this report since the proposal before us will undermine the basis for danish redundancy pay
would he not also accept that the removal of dutyfree sales will make travel more expensive thereby infringing the spirit of the treaty which calls for an evercloser union of the peoples of europe
europe must respond to new global challenges turning the european economy into a highly competitive social market economy and stimulating noticeable growth with more and better jobs

finally the questions raised here by certain member states need answers and the presidency needs to keep its promise and organise a meeting of experts to examine the points which some members feel are still outstanding
britain should follow the example of france and germany and protect its own national interests and those of its domestic energy consumers
the law had been enacted by the rightwing unionist government of margaret thatcher a government which had no legitimacy among the people of scotland
is it the case that when the absurd act does not concern individual structures but the entire world it becomes more acceptable
the countries that have to ratify it by referendum particularly need clear guidance
in addition the swedish presidency has clarified the fact that it is appropriate as the eu s civil crisis management continues to develop also to establish other areas within the framework of civil crisis management in which eu resources may need to be developed or used more effectively
it even sounds rather condescending as if the man was the first creation and women were a mere afterthought
the majority of countries in the balkans are in the throes of forming nation states which is a difficult and delicate process that could come to grief at any time and that has to be handled with both sensitivity and knowledge
from the very first teams they will develop in accordance with the competences that they have been and will be given
we can condemn it and we do of course also want an explanation of the gas that was used of the circumstances in which action was taken and of how the forces of law and order acted
i want to devote the main part of my time to say that nothing i say nothing can justify terrorism attacks against civilians and massacres of the innocent
i want to welcome the rigorous work carried out in a constructive spirit by this parliament and in particular by mr schwab as rapporteur and by mrs ferreira who is not here today but is represented by mrs van den burg and mrs starkeviciute who worked in cooperation with eurostat and the commission to arrive at this debate
this report lays down rules which are firmer and clearer in different ways than the ones that were recommended by the commission although we did not receive everything that we needed
madam president i wish to open my speech by joining others in conveying my deepest sympathy to you commissioner in light of what is happening in your country
there is clearly a great deal of ethnographic data which can be collected and protected as world heritage
i also believe we must stress that a number of countries that were very critical at the brussels summit and i include my own spain together with poland germany and france amongst others have publicly expressed by means of their ministers their will to reach an agreement
firstly the fact that the rules on exchanges of information which have been in place since the beginning of this parliamentary term have not been implemented
in the commissions view such decisions should preferably encompass all additional protocols and should be taken together with the decision concluding the accession agreement itself
european agriculture should not however need this intervention
the european union is also providing aid to selected institutions with a view to strengthening civil society
let me tell you that those who deny the validity years on from the signing of the treaties of rome of the universally recognised and familiar symbols of the eu are symbolically adding grist to the mills of those who questioning european integration as such wish to turn their backs on it and return to their own identities as nation states
very well that is to be the unchanging rule
in the final analysis it is the member states that bear responsibility for the safe management of any spent fuel and radioactive waste that they produce including its safe storage
finally it is positive because it promotes sustainable fishing in the area it includes a mechanism for objectively analysing fish stocks and establishes mechanisms for scientific cooperation to that end
hence there must also be a strategy for childcare
my question is have you ever considered giving some leadership and quitting the bad habit and encouraging your senators to follow suit
that would represent the highest rhythm of increase in our gdp since the lisbon strategy was launched in
finally it is rather apt following mrs scallon that i say this let us remind ourselves in this house that these young people will become the generation that finally rid our continent of racism sexism homophobia xenophobia and the other discriminations which shame us all
the draft proposal which was supported by eight committees starts out from challenges to which the new multiannual financial framework has to respond as well
internal market scoreboard
it is a fact that confusion helps nobody
i believe it is vital to emphasise that we understand the effort that south africa is making often in a courageous and innovative manner with significant victories such as the one it has just gained in the matter of aids for instance against the great pharmaceutical industry
national traditions cultural peculiarities massive or residual xenophobia and a greater or lesser openness to the claims of minorities explain the differences between the member states immigration policies
the commissions request for a prolongation itself came at a very late stage
we expressed criticism at the right time and in the right place of the notorious injustices which are taking place as the eu countries have done together year after year since and it was not our fault that there were some who did not wish to join in this time
thank you very much for that answer
i too was disappointed at what i read and heard of events in bali
one of the election issues is the lack of cod
with regard to action the european council invited the commission to consider several problems
i really think we should use the remaining days up to cancun to try to deliver all we pledged in copenhagen
voting in favour of a resolution is unfortunately the only thing parliament can do to be heard in the negotiations of the fisheries partnership agreement
but it is important to stress that the cooperation we have had from the italians has helped in this process as with previous budgets whether it be under the finns french belgians or danes although with the finns it was rather nerveracking when we all came into this chamber with two different voting lists on the final day
the oral amendment was rejected as more than members supported mr wolfs proposal
dr jahangir thank you very much for your address
so we proposed new decisionmaking powers for the agency in particular over the development of the technical codes which my colleagues just mentioned and the investment plans of the tsos and a greater regulatory and financial independence
punishments which are applied in accordance with sharia law in twelve states of your country
this is a considerably more positive attitude than that prior to in which greece wanted to avoid any use of the name macedonia for its neighbours to the north
free movement the opening of the borders globalization and free trade offer great new opportunities for economic growth and employment
and just for the record they do not mainly benefit spain as you maintain they mainly benefit the netherlands
i have to say that i have just had my birthday
i should like to start by asking my fellow members not to be fooled by the offputting statistics some have put forward
allow me to illustrate this with two examples
then we will have achieved complete success
mr president i too would like to thank the court of auditors
the amendments concerned recognition of the added value of the outermost regions in the fields of space renewable energies energy selfsufficiency and biodiversity the importance of public service for the development of the ors acknowledgement of the lack of integration of the ors into the european research area recognition of the benefit of the netbiome programme and the ors ability to make a significant contribution to established international priorities
that is why commissioner at a time when the unemployment rate in europe is going to exceed the mark when there are more than one and a half billion poor workers in the world and when the crisis is hitting a further million poor workers it is time for the leaders to focus on the social consequences of the crisis and to give priority to employment
we believe that specific dialogue is needed with the two countries that voted no in their referendums
to that end the commission has proposed to establish a responsibility mechanism within the union
however negotiations have not led to the enactment of a binding directive because the council and commission do not want that at this stage
that would be a mistake
thank you ladies and gentlemen
these are highly charged questions which are best dealt with from the perspectives of the member states themselves and in cooperation with legitimate international organisations competent for these matters
despite the efforts made a great deal remains to be done
although i admire his erudition his critique of how budgeting should work did rather call to my mind that it perhaps accounts for why the liberals have now been out of power in the united kingdom since
i subscribe to this approach and this clear stance
overcoming difficulties in order to reconcile a career and family life too often remains problem for women only and they also often feel the consequences on their income during their retirement
parliament emphasises the many advantages of highquality agriculture which i support
i repeated it and that is how things are
mr president europe is in the unique position of not having any enemies who threaten it militarily
sales may not exceed sales by more than or by for every year thereafter up until
in developing all other policies i am absolutely certain that the european commission will continue to seek to give prominence to the critical question of encouraging and supporting women as the majority gender in the population of the world as indeed in our continent and union
of course it is despicable and it is a serious problem both within the eu and in the rest of the world
ms read pointed out that the member states are very sensitive to this issue
to be specific the u is calling for alignment on issues of terrorism judicial and police cooperation even participation in its actions within the framework of foreign policy and defence policy offering training for the necessary political and military staff
today mr cohnbendit said something very interesting but he presented it as a paradox
the union has had a policy on small and mediumsized businesses for such a long time but the benefits of the union sometimes seem very far off especially for small businesses
i would therefore like to draw the attention of this house to the fact that it is unacceptable to allow such an important part of our continent to remain under the sole control of a single military peacekeeping force
i do not think that we can turn a blind eye to this
the next item is the debate on the report of the european council and the commission statement on the informal european council at hampton court to which parliament was invited as you know represented by its president
any government should do the opposite in fact
commissioner one of my requests would be that we do not let major disruptions occur in our programmes in future
between and million say the specialists that money does not exist in the financial institutions mr commissioner
perhaps a number of these elements in certain lights and considered in isolation may suggest an international organisation
also surely the mechanisms of market support should be replaced by a more proactive policy for example one which establishes the compulsory levying of a countervailing charge on the import of species found in the community amounting to the difference between the import price and the current guide price which could be used to promote the fishing industry in the developing countries
i am pleased to see that we have finally emerged from the impasse reached in the discussions between parliament and the council on the socrates ii programme this house has managed to remain very firm on its position during this long conciliation procedure
under pressure from rocketing rents they fall into debt and are often evicted
he knows that in the story the people rejoiced but in fact the emperor had no clothes on at all and this is what he must ensure does not happen here
it may close a few loopholes but open up others
you also said you will dismiss from office a member of the commission who behaves inappropriately
many features of the elections were of a standard which left much to be desired
to come back to the football match today in spain in madrid the match was delayed by an hour because the goalposts fell down
i hope that the rapporteur will be able to support all these proposals if she is allowed to sleep on it
a second problem is that labelling is envisaged for meat and meatbased products
mr president i too would like to welcome our mediterranean friends and colleagues and also sincerely to congratulate yannis sakellariou on his work
the only conclusion we could draw therefore is that more of these agreements are needed in the region in the short term
what does this endless debate teach us
your motion for a resolution is rightly addressed to all interested institutions and likewise to member states
as part of a world trade organisation agreement the eu the usa japan canada switzerland norway and macao in china have decided to reduce the duties on certain pharmaceutical products and active ingredients to zero
for example we could and should have discussed the western sahara
european citizens also want this crisis to be an opportunity for europe for civil europe
we are doing that and we will keep doing that in the dda negotiations
madam president ladies and gentlemen commissioner ciolos thank you for the encouraging words you have just spoken and thank you to mr scotta for the sensitive work that he has done on this important report
there has been a tenfold increase in traffic through the road tunnels under the alps over the last fifteen years
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen a lot of very worthwhile points have been made about the pronk report and i agree with the calls for general solidarity and for a realistic and careful approach to a new society in which the concept of care has assumed a whole new dimension all of these things must be included in the programme
i can simply say to you mrs ludford that your question comes just at the right moment since in an hour and a half myself as the representative of the presidency and commissioner rehn will travel to cyprus to try to discuss the issues that you have just raised
this becomes stranger still in view of the fact that the first objective of structural policy is the sustainable development of the union
quite rightly a number of the motions for a resolution tabled regarding the forthcoming gothenburg summit press for a stronger environmental policy a social europe and respect for the rights of the albanians in macedonia
in asia as in europe empires and ethnicism are the enemies of the nation
when we see someone with a disability instead of focusing on the disability let us treat everyone as equal focus on their ability and give them the tools of information of training of education and of opportunity to really show how much ability they actually have
you received it enthusiastically
unconditional subjection to its own ideology or death that was the message of the franco regime
a certain freedom is also required in regional development for example in state subsidies without competition necessarily becoming endangered or distorted
parliament is well represented by those three gentlemen
it was not just the symbols of the economic and collective freedom of the west that were the targets on september we have all been affected
i hope that the political will that is needed on this matter is felt at the highest level
when times are hardest no one would ever consider saying that we have to spend more
the rules thus need to be drastically changed and supervision tightened
we exceeded the ceilings in three categories in category b we will have to see how parliament votes on thursday
we wish him well but express regret that as a result of his taking up this appointment we shall lose him before the end of this legislature
there is no alternative
these essential but shortterm measures cannot however take the place of a comprehensive approach to terrorism and of increasing diplomatic pressure on countries such as pakistan
lambert report
therefore ladies and gentlemen my commission is ready to fully play its part together with you
what we want to do is get the regions and the communities involved in the design of the policy and updating on a regular basis
it simply has not
mr president commissioner the climate summit held recently in the hague dealt with the requirements of the kyoto protocol to notoriously meagre effect
in my view four objectives are set by the present amendment to the guideline
in the last two years the number of yearold students studying languages has dropped by as much as as our government has made it an option rather than a compulsory element of the curriculum
thirdly the networks are in need of longterm investment and that cannot be maintained on the basis of high yields in the short term
we shall have a socalled play off at the end of the negotiations between the wishes which the member states still have and the wishes which the candidates have basically their wishes concern transition periods
the white paper and the report are contributions made at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection discussion and reform which has yet to be concluded because there are still a few questions posed by ourselves the judiciary the member states and above all the smes concerned that need to be clarified
well done commissioner
it is full of technical detail but mr carraro has managed splendidly to raise the economically and politically important questions
the scientific committee on food made assessments on lead and cadmium in the diet and advised upon safe intake levels
we need them but they must be based on sound science on the latest facts from these different sectors and policy areas
i support the new legislative proposal because it will update the regulations in force and introduce safety features which will guarantee the identification authentication and traceability of medicines from the factory to the consumer
i am against crosssubsidies for the same reason
a case has been filed with the paris military court regarding the complicity of french soldiers in the genocide and crimes against humanity committed in rwanda in
although the government acquiesced straight away this does not mean that we should not question this hasty and largely unwarranted decision
while the peacebuilding commission carries out its work fairly effectively and has largely met expectations the same cannot be said with the best will in the world about the human rights council
that is why i would like the council to take as its motto recollection not reversal
we would delete the german version as it stands as well
the modes of procedure presented in the white paper are well balanced and i believe they involve a step forwards in the direction of sustainable development
is this we ask ourselves the death of ideology
i think we need to look for a far more pragmatic solution
this constitutes support precisely for strengthening the rights of users and consumers
it is only through reciprocal action and modern and universal rules that trade can help improve not only the living conditions of citizens outside europe in the world in general but also the living conditions and survival of european workers and entrepreneurs who want to keep producing and living in and exporting from europe
that is precisely the point that we want to discuss
on the one hand it refuses to raise the financial ceiling for category and this is only right
we regret the fact that it is still not possible now finally to bring the tax systems in europe closer together and to gear them to one another
there is also another aspect to consider
if you comply with these two requests then we will be more than content
since it is better to have any kind of work than none at all i now see increasing numbers of people in such a plight that they are forced to accept this type of employment despite the fact that it involves no social safeguards whatsoever and in terms of workers rights falls far short of the benefits enjoyed by fulltime workers
commissioner i am sure you will agree with us all that it really is time now to stop talking and start acting
as liberal democrats we want to see trade agreements without bureaucratic structures or centralism and we want them to remove control of resources and wealth from some oligarchic structures currently holding sway in the partner countries
we rely very much on the united nations to advise the iraqis on compliance with the principles of international law
romanias parliament palace consumes as much power as a town with inhabitants
it is also supported by communities like anglesey in north wales who already have a nuclear power station
finally i should like to say a few words about enlargement
i find that sentence very amusing
it is an extremely valuable means of informal learning that favours cultural exchange and gives young people the tools they need to develop within a global professional environment
as you know the council and parliament are now negotiating to have the resettlement programme in place and this is also an area where the european commission could look at possibilities for financing quite a lot of it
you can see right through it
we know from experience that famine is a political and social problem not a technical problem
that puts europeans in a worse position on the labour market because they are forced to compete with cheap labour from elsewhere
by way of comparison consider that nafta comprising the united states mexico and canada has a population of around million
it has also been said that no liberalisation offer has been made by europe in the fields of health education or audiovisual media
starch potato production requires expensive special investments resulting in high cost prices of around ff ha
i do not think that will be possible since we all come from different countries with different traditions
ladies and gentlemen you will not achieve your aims by shouting while another member is speaking
anyone who monitors the numbers and geographical distribution of redundancies in the graphics sector in the netherlands which are the reason for the various applications to mobilise the european globalisation adjustment fund will surely be alarmed to see how numerous and widespread they are
allow me to recall that distribution costs make up on average of the price of a new car
and this time i am not referring to the frenchor the german but to the death and mutilation of people with a value as human beings that cannot be expressed in money terms
an orderly withdrawal of course needs alternatives for those employed in these sectors
and finally i apologise to you and colleagues for not staying for the rest of the debate but as ever there are double bookings going on in this house
turning to heading that of internal affairs everyone rehearsed the role of the agencies and the problems inherent in communicating with the public
madam president on november the procedures were adhered to in a formal sense but everyone is well aware that there is a deterioration in the community spirit
as part of the renewed lisbon strategy the spring summit will therefore be devoted to those issues given priority in the national reform programmes and the european commissions report namely research development and innovation policy for small and mediumsized enterprises employment and energy
at the same time let me emphasise in this proposal we have adhered to the principle of sharing the burden with regard to the physical reception of the refugees
secondly mr oostlanders report makes frequent reference to democratic legitimacy the rule of law and democracy i am thinking in particular of paragraph
during the compromise negotiations i noticed that the group of socialists is generally opposed to historical debates
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i would firstly like to congratulate mrs jeggle on the report that she has produced on the work she has done and on having achieved the practically unanimous support of the committee on agriculture for her report
what is happening in italy is not an italian issue it is a european issue because the very credibility of the european union is at risk when it controls and judges infringements of fundamental principles and rights in third countries and tolerates infringement of those same values and principles in its own back yard
we must be able to make mr prodi and his new commissioner aware of your proposal to have commissioners come and give detailed replies to questions which are relevant to them
we support the commissions overall efforts to bring about agricultural reform particularly the importance it attaches to a broader rural development policy
the eu must be more proactive when it comes to energy efficiency both from the point of view of being true to its word and its stance on environmental issues as in kyoto and in terms of economic and environmental common sense
surely they must have some rights under eu law as eu citizens
however it is up to each member state to set the rules as long as they follow the recommendations and the limit values set in the directive
these indicators should make it clear that we should get out of the euro zone and that the individual nations should regain their competence for economic social and monetary decisionmaking in a free europe where protection and national and community preference take first place
will it understand that european responses to european challenges the euro energy research and innovation and employment are being sought in good faith
i believe that special attention should be paid to this
i ask the council to indicate what its attitude is to upgrading the human rights working group to a subcommittee which would meet regularly and keep some kind of pressure on the israeli authorities to comply with human rights norms which we all expect civilised societies and democracies to comply with
since then i and some of my colleagues and in particular mr giansily have been looking into why the commission is finding it so difficult to implement these funds effectively and quickly after all they are supposed to constitute an immediate aid to reconstruction and to get them to where they are needed
one point that has to be made in this context though is that responsibility for security cannot ultimately be passed on to the ports alone this is on the contrary a task for all those involved in transport and that is something we must not forget
in fact the registration system proposed by the commission for users of nutritional supplements would in practice create a register of breeders parallel to that provided for in article of directive ec which has the aim of ensuring the correct use of substances in stock farming
mr presidentinoffice of the council you face major challenges over the next six months partly in connection with the constitutional treaty
at the same time i propose that with adequate regulation the solidarity fund should be opened up to the partial alleviation of industrial catastrophes i emphasise partial
i think that we should switch to the electric car as soon as possible as the commissioner has already said
they judge politicians by their actions which may lead to major shifts
we cannot accept this excessive striving for profits to the detriment of human development
the group of the european peoples party and european democrats has proposed including the issue of the situation in lebanon following the assassination of former prime minister mr hariri in the council and commission statements on eu relations with the mediterranean region
finally we should stick firmly to subsidiarity and keeping decisionmaking within the industry and close to fans
i shall finish here but i think that we are going to have to have a much broader debate on this issue in future
the gralerivellini report increases budgetary and financial responsibility improves transparency and promotes the eeass effectiveness
if flexibility is not limited to a precise area and specific decisions but extended to the very objectives of the union sooner or later it will lead to fragmentation of the union
this may be the reason that whilst it is worthwhile and whilst we can welcome the protection of workers representatives who support complainants against discrimination on the other hand we have done away with the protection of possible witnesses or of individuals who witness the harassment or discrimination that some individuals experience and i think this is a real pity
after the first five years of implementation of the tampere decisions restricting democratic rights and freedoms and the antilabour lisbon strategy they are planning a second fiveyear attack with new more repressive antigrass roots measures
this reorientation also means and even that was not so simple that a change of consciousness has taken place at least in some member states such as germany greece and ireland
so it was no coincidence that in france for example and in some other parts of the european union the highest earning regions also received the highest compensatory payments though i should make it very clear that on this occasion this had nothing to do with a european parliament resolution
in order to achieve this fifa has undertaken to introduce rules dealing with firstly compensation for training costs incurred up to the age of on the basis of real costs in line with the court s judgment in the bosman case and secondly the creation of a solidarity fund which will be sustained by a levy on each compensation payment for transfer this fund is intended for the training clubs who will thereby receive a share of the player s added value
and we are facing difficulties as everyone must agree to do with tax liability the protection of information and information of a harmful or illegal nature
what i have done today is to report on how the commission and i want to tackle this problem how we must analyse it how we must work with a strategy and a programme in which we consider each greenhouse gas in turn and how exactly we are to manage the problems there are already proposals on the table
we are monitoring this issue
taking advantage of the opportunity provided by the relevant forecast in the draft directive and bearing in mind that the start of a new round of multilateral negotiations is approaching we urge the commission and the council to take the necessary actions to institute at international level a means of ensuring that interest on bank deposits and revenues from bonds of all kinds and other financial products are taxed such actions must be targeted at large international institutional investors and more generally at legal entities
when modernising and extending road networks it is important to pay attention to the surroundings
whoever is beaten will also have his role to play and the winner will have to take this into account
thank you mr herman for the valuable report which you have presented to us which i am sure will be appreciated by all your colleagues

regardless of the differences between them the christians there have managed on many occasions to demonstrate that they are able to live alongside muslims jews or followers of other religions in peace and mutual respect
throughout this process the commission has done its best to facilitate agreement between the council and parliament and to find balanced compromises
i hope this is the beginning of better cooperation between the police and home affairs authorities on the one hand and the health and social authorities on the other
the fate of ukraine currently hangs in the balance and if it swings towards democracy it will enrich the whole of europe
firstly the food shortage that is rife in many countries in the world is quite rightly unacceptable
this means that they have to stick rigidly to their treatment regime and that distribution channels are therefore needed to ensure that the patients concerned can always obtain their medicines
this would not be the first such action
social cohesion and the achievements of a social europe are those factors which people consider the most important
with regard to parliamentary activity the tdi group shall immediately enjoy all rights accorded by the rules of procedure to duly constituted political groups with regard to finance and administration this group has the right to sufficient staffing to enable it to function and to the appropriations allocated to political groups according to the current scale
hence the importance attached to this proposed directive despite its limited nature i believe it constitutes a significant contribution to providing what has hitherto not existed ie no more nor less than the opportunity to have ones legal status actively recognized in a country where one is not domiciled
this is a country that has largely been destroyed and its people are without hope
no matter which way we choose we must take a clear stand and this means at least holding a debate on the issue
perhaps it could be done in the same way it was done with the countries of the western balkans ie with the energy community treaty or maybe in some other way
i believe that the timing and scope of the proposal are correct
we always take into account the need to increase the coverage of this public register
its president jacques de larosiere appeared before the confederal group of the european united leftnordic green left to report to us on its activities
when the sector is reformed the emphasis should on the contrary be placed on the direct and indirect employment which the sector provides particularly in the most backward areas of the eu many of which have no alternative crops to produce
users of the electricity sector and the postal service are already experiencing difficulties of a similar nature
mr president in the proposals which he has formulated in the report under discussion our rapporteur mr evans is calling for the commission to relax the competition rules for horizontal cooperation agreements between companies operating at the same market level
they are in oil they are in the north of sudan but it is definitely a great help when the broader international community tries to find a solution to the issues
someone said earlier that perhaps it would be a good thing if out of this development policy out of this new impetus the magical idea of europe could be given a new impetus
madam president i just wanted to express on behalf of the european peoples party our unconditional support for the resolution intended to demonstrate our solidarity in the face of the fire which has destroyed an important building from a heritage and historical point of view in other words the lisbon city hall and launching an appeal for the commission to give its support for the rebuilding of the city hall as far as it can
however it was the court of auditors that carried out the audit an institution that has no form of personal interest in the matter and it is no good playing down the mistakes

he can discuss this issue in the council with representatives of the greek government
there are many studies indicating the problems mentioned here in this house especially the bird and veterinary report but these should not mean a delay in taking necessary measures
when comments are issued it is the presidency that issues them
we very much hope that it takes up the challenge
i think we must introduce legislation as quickly as possible which will include an unconditional requirement for the same information to be given by third countries which market their goods in the eu
this is no small matter
on our side this dispute threatens assistance for two peripheral regions mr mendonca will doubtless mention madeira and for poor acp countries which have no satisfactory alternative to banana production as for the americans this dispute does not threaten the interests of their own farmers just those of extremely powerful multinationals which operate in latin american countries
hence we consider that the recent commission proposal for the management of fishing effort in the atlantic calls into question the objectives of conservation and the ability of portugal in particular to carry out conservation measures in its exclusive economic zone
it was very clear colleagues
but meanwhile in the precarious situation in which community producers find themselves here and now the action we request is the only possible response to the emergency conditions we are experiencing since the future of the salmon farming industry demands these decisions
in stockholm the majority of families consist of one person
as businesses grow they must adhere to regulations that may not be open to them as microentities and the member states freedom of choice in these circumstances weakens the single market
public works public supply and public service contracts account for eur billion each year in the union which means and shows that this legislation concerns the very powerhouse of the communitys economy

according to the proposal at least by mass of any vehicle should be reusable andor recyclable and at least by mass of any vehicle should be reusable andor recoverable
she was paraded as their star inmate
there is a lot to be said for an allembracing approach to such issues of legal assistance and improved cooperation within the judicial field that is not limited just to environmental law
that is my answer to mr aylward
the european institutions are thus bound by law to respect the provisions of these staff regulations
this dossier requires our concerted attention in order to put these improvements in place without further delay they will bring huge benefits in terms of both consumer protection and innovation in the food sector
the second point i should like to make is that increasing the setaside and milk quotas is a welcome measure but in my opinion increasing the production cost of pesticides in view of rising oil prices may be a measure that will not pay off
commissioner you may say that it is clear that no unauthorised product can enter the eu market but that has simply not been the case
if you were to ask me which of the innovations in the european constitution was the most significant i would have no hesitation in saying the foreign affairs minister
so please commissioner yes to research but yes also to a moratorium now

the european legislator can legislate in respect of any product in circulation within the union but he must follow the dictates of international law because when european enterprises export to third countries which require animal experimentation for european products these must conform to the laws of those countries

if they are giving answers can i suggest that they email their answers to the meps as well so we can use the information not just to the press who often just spike it

i should like to thank the rapporteur for grasping the importance of the information technologies in reducing the environmental burden of development actions for example by reducing the need for mobility or the need for transport infrastructures

i should like it to be more substantial especially as regards the unified assistance clause but in all events it is good for us to show that we learned from the war in iraq
in the social sphere environmental issues are also important such as access to potable water and sanitary conditions access to education and health care systems and the fight against poverty
in writing today an important vote was held
mr barnier we know is now going to have a look at strategy and i hope will pick up many of these things
madam president ladies and gentlemen thank you very much for your attention
for example demographic change with higher life expectancies which has been mentioned here this afternoon undoubtedly obliges us to adopt new policies and not just health policies but also sociohealth care policies which will allow us to combine the higher life expectancy with greater quality of life

today the lasting peace and wellbeing created by the eu is a guarantee for facing potential challenges
their markets are far from being saturated
the other extreme if i may cite an example is luxembourg which by comparison has a very liberal moneylaundering legislation which basically only comes up to the minimum standard laid down in the directive
furthermore there is it seems to me within the agreement some considerable disregard for the expanding needs of the artisanal fishing fleet and warnings about the decline in fishing stocks
that was how things stood before and in light of that the fact that we have a decision at all constitutes an enormous success
in addition the prevention and fight against the consequences of natural disasters must be supported by concern for protecting the sea and adjacent zones against possible industrial accidents such as the recent oil disaster in the gulf of mexico
another way of increasing efficiency is to strengthen our educational systems by making them more adaptable to the needs of individuals
i think it has been an interesting debate whatever ones view is on the european project and on the lisbon treaty
many previous speakers have already said so
that is the underlying logic of this process and this dynamic
one definition of political priorities and translation of these into practical measures through the focused use of resources
admittedly aid workers cannot solve crises of political origin
with these substantially improved control rights we see no need for the legislator to set a time limit for the delegation of implementing powers to the commission
fifthly in taking a stance on this issue or trying to answer these questions it is often forgotten that twothirds of the workforce are employed in the private sector in familyowned companies and the majority of those familyowned companies are smes that do not seek finance from the capital markets
in recent years especially as a result of the world economic crisis portugal has been feeling the effects of the problem of how to reabsorb and reintegrate the unemployed into the labour market

i call on the council and the governments of the member states in particular france and spain to stop being so accommodating visavis the moroccan authorities and to involve themselves more actively in the success of the peace plan and the holding of the referendum for that is the most appropriate democratic means of achieving a peaceful and lasting settlement of the conflict in western sahara
each member state can decide itself whether to join an international convention devoted to matters that do not fall within the exclusive competence of the community
access to education and training needs to be further encouraged in order to allow young farmers to take full advantage of the potential advantages offered by modern communication technology and business operation techniques

we must admit that the situation is very different from one member state to another
that is why our question to the commission includes points that we have identified in conversation with the people affected
i would like to end by thanking the rapporteur for her willingness to reach this consensus not just in the committee but also here in parliament and i hope that the commission will show goodwill in terms of the future since that is what the sector is impatiently awaiting
peace cooperation the rule of law and inviolable borders must form the backbone to our policy along with constant efforts to improve the democratic institutions and standard of living in all these hardhit regions

the guillotine and the electric chair are symbols of the modern age
mr president ladies and gentlemen that the eu had to respond to the enormous increase in the number of patent applications in this area is not a matter of doubt nor is there any doubt about the fact that these must not be allowed to be detrimental to the interests of small software companies
the directive therefore needs to be implemented as soon as possible
i would also like to point out in respect of the environment the effort to base tourist development on the criteria of sustainability and maintaining and enhancing the cultural and historical heritage which have always been priority objectives and the subjects of much involvement in many of the ultraperipheral and island regions of the european union
with the conciliation now arrived at between parliament and the council i believe however that we have found a sensible balance and we in the alde group are able to support the conciliation

this report shows the satisfactory results for real convergence achieved in portugal over recent years but also points out the need for continually monitoring those developments in great detail and to find out more accurately the impact of financial measures taken through the structural funds as well as the results obtained and finding out exactly what those results were
i shall conclude by emphasising good practice
mr president mr president of the council mr commissioner i think it is proper that the speech from commissioner leon brittan was somewhat longer than usual because it was a very full and important speech

i have stressed in all meetings with the tunisian authorities on behalf of the european commission that they had to deliver on their democratic and human rights commitments
the elections were called six months prior to those events and have no particular connection to subsequent political developments nor could those developments have contributed to the emergence of any new candidates
in such a context for example i could dwell at length but i will not on the need to speed up forms of coordination for fiscal policies
several months ago many politicians doubted whether a small country in central and eastern europe would be able to carry the burden of leadership of the european union
they are from bottom up practically all included in our activities and we are trying to find a proper way of having this coordinated
it affects every taxpayer and all those who are dependent on government funds because more and more billions in public money have to be used to repair the damage
we must make it clear perhaps through foreign policy measures but also by promoting competition that there must be a difference in ownership between the producers and the suppliers who own the pipelines in order not for example to make gazprom even more likely to be not only the biggest producer but also to control the supply chain and thus to hold all the trumps
we therefore also raised the situation in belarus at the ministerial troika with minister lavrov last week
this can also be seen from the financial corrections quoted under number
the council is at present examining the possibilities open to the union for making a contribution in the humanitarian and cultural sphere within the framework of existing resolutions concerning iraq from the un security council

the remainder should follow their example so as to ensure that gender equality will actually become a reality across the union in the future and not remain merely wishful thinking
at the same time i recognise the fact that even more protection is not essential
moreover we are prepared to start immediately
perhaps we as parliament should be given a temporary foot and mouth inquiry committee modelled on the bse inquiry committee
in addition to this budgetary boost it is also essential to strengthen support for turkey by means of credit on favourable terms and we therefore support the rate of risk cover by the community budget
the legislation of all member states prohibits illegal and undeclared work especially with the dual absurdity we have here of illegal entry to the member state and illegal exploitation
that is why we are working on joint multiannual programming based on strategies to combat poverty which give us a better picture of how funds are targeted and according to what objectives and which also enable us to control this allocation better

moreover money laundering is responsible for financing the evil trade in drugs trafficking in humans and other horrific crimes
but we should also note encouraging developments the new social legislation on the rights of women the supervision of elections by the courts and the important rulings by courts on the constitutionality of contentious legislation

calendar of partsessions see minutes
this is not acceptable
if we just take a wide scattering of cattle off the market and out of the herds it is not going to be an effective cull

this particularly applies in areas within the eu where distances are great and where a lot of small companies are involved in dismantling vehicles
mr president i would like to pay tribute to our rapporteur mr karas who has shown superb judgement in reaching a broadly acceptable balance in this complex but vitally important directive

the terrorist belongs to the armata corsa organisation
to do this it is necessary to give top priority to the objectives of sustainable human development based on the appropriation by the poorest countries of the means of development through the exploitation of their human resources

that is why we should vote first on the more radical amendment proposed by the green group in the european parliament and then on our amendment which does not reject such research in principle but formulates very strict conditions for it

europe must have a genuine return on the funding it grants in order on the one hand to monitor that the projects are effectively carried out and that public monies are being put to good use and on the other hand to optimise the new programmes
the nagornokarabakh conflict has been referred to and it has made the economic situation in azerbaijan even more difficult
plant protection products are expensive and no farmer will apply more than is absolutely necessary

and i should particularly like to thank the author of this report mr fernandez martin for the quality of his work as well as mr pomes who spoke on his behalf i should also like to thank all those speakers who participated in the debate
but you will appreciate that it is not up to the council to advocate any particular model of social dialogue at national level because that lies entirely within the competence of each member state

first and foremost we must be clear that it will be difficult to get the better of serbia with sanctions as mr van den broek said very clearly earlier what we must do is leave serbia in no doubt that if this genocide continues it will end up alienating itself from the international community with all the resulting consequences
whatever international obligations we have i believe should be subordinated to that constitutional right
this can be done relatively quickly
let us be capable of taking on this responsibility
in reply to the last question put by mr metten it is true that we were in a special situation because in the past rightly or wrongly the commission accepted this system

i agree with professor cot when he says that the proposal for a council decision hinges on two major questions firstly on the allocation of competences because many of the aspects assigned by the convention and the agreement are the responsibility of the community because of the treaties and therefore powers must be granted to the countries which make up the european union and by establishing a ratification instrument the communitys participation will finally be strengthened and the problem resolved
secondly if we now want to increase public transport and networking it intelligently plays a crucial role in the solution the question then arises of course whether we will be able to use capital from the structural funds for this purpose at all

in short a little semantic correctness would not go amiss

some womens lives could have been saved if their appeals for help had been heeded and this shows that the problem of violence against women is related not only to domestic situations made difficult by marginalization or poverty but also to deeprooted social values which make allowances for the attacker
these fears and doubts also betray uncertainty and incomprehension on the part of the citizens which characterize this phase of the construction of europe
the purely bilateral dispute over names between macedonia and greece should not encourage greece to enter a veto

mr berthu told me that he himself had thought of asking for a referral back to committee but then in effect i realised that the vote had been taken under rule and not
in summary we are happy with the commission s efforts to regroup the broad and diverse regulations referring to highly migratory fish although these efforts present us with decisions that have already been adopted and which are binding at an international level because no objections have been raised against them the commission is furthermore only making these efforts in order to achieve greater legal certainty
the european unions volume of fishing is very moderate and i naturally agree with the rapporteurs complaint that there is a kind of discrimination by virtue of which in the agreements with the south it is the fishermen who have to pay while in the case of the agreements with the north this increase in payments that they now want to impose on us is not happening

measures to promote a culture of enterprise in the eu have been taken at community and national levels but members of parliament will appreciate that to change a culture is not easy
however a direct deduction of any spending items from the deficit is excluded
however i would also like to make it clear and this is why we are in the centre that we also do not entirely agree with the feeling that we sometimes get that the rapporteur although subsequently he was generous in accepting amendments from other groups does not really have or at times may not have had sufficient sensitivity to assess what the general interest means to understand that not everything is subject to the rules of the market to understand that the member states do of course have to have and retain the freedom to protect certain services outside of the pure market in a regulated form or by providing them solely through the public sector
the european perspective for ukraine is of course also an important issue
this is also the case for the european legal space this was already the major priority of the spanish presidency in

not only the commission but also parliament and the council must contribute resources however
the manufacturers say with some justification that it is surely not consistent with the polluterpays principle to expect presentday manufacturers to pay for the recovery of a chandelier which has been hanging in someone s lounge and which was produced twenty years ago by some manufacturer or other who is no longer in business
simply saying that this is important is not enough
the commissioner rightly points out that this is the most dynamic sector
the proposal for a federalstyle budgetary system in paragraph is also one we oppose
that means the member states must give the commission a clear negotiating mandate so that at the time of the rd session of the icao assembly in it can vigorously pursue the environmental and transport policy objectives
unfortunately though you have not been successful in giving europe the change the citizens asked for and that is more subsidiarity less bureaucracy and more policy

i would also like to call for the work on the draft directive on admission to be speeded up along with the work on the directive regulating procedures for returning immigrants to their countries of origin
this is why we revised the small business act making it consistent with the single market act which is able to show synergy with the innovation union as well
the final version of the new directive on geneticallymodified organisms certainly has some good points such as improved controls public registers the gradual elimination of antibioticresistant gene markers etc
the key point here following the hearing held jointly by the committee on economic and monetary affairs and the committee on civil liberties justice and home affairs last october is the briefing of the article working group which on november clearly confirmed our concerns namely that in the swift case data that should manifestly not have been concealed from the us authorities had in fact been concealed and that accordingly the directive had not been complied with
unlike in december when we discussed nice in the absence of the central european countries estonia latvia and lithuania poland czechoslovakia slovakia hungary and slovenia not to mention malta and cyprus none of whom had yet joined us it is a particularly happy circumstance that today the day when we are debating the constitution we have among us members from these countries particularly from those european countries that were once communist

mr sacredeus i understand that proximity to an eu external border is naturally something that may cause concern but believe me the external border with norway is the least of our worries because norway is a country with which we have an agreement within the schengen convention and is a country that for all intents and purposes is in practice a full member of the european family
we look forward to the expansion and integration of these networks with the countries of eastern europe
mr president i would like to add my thanks to louise mcvay to the rapporteur and also to my two colleagues from the region mr helmer who is here today and will be speaking later on and to mr heaton harris who also followed this matter very closely

that is a change which we have already managed to achieve the opposition is now on all these committees
otherwise we will unfortunately jeopardise both the result of the election and peoples interest in participating in the election in bosnia

as the commissioner is also aware the council has already made a decision

mr president commissioner honourable members i should first like to reply to mrs beres firstly by providing a brief retrospective on what has happened over the last year or so

and since the intergovernmental conference is producing no genuine progress in this area i fear that such reports are going to take the same form in the future
for we have a principle in this european union of ours the socialist principle of redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor

i would like to illustrate this with one number from what is a very complicated title

firstly i would like to thank mr staes for tabling a question on adding water and protein to chicken meat
as far as the green paper is concerned i must express a certain reticence mainly because numerous new policy initiatives have been started important matters are in the pipeline in various councils and we are now in a position to take action on illiteracy it would perhaps mean additional delays if we were to proceed with the green paper given that we now have most of the information we need from work carried out in previous years
poor old europe the noncommunicable subject it would appear

just yesterday the un made once again the link between development and conflict and pointed out that those countries that are in conflict are of course those that have the hardest time getting out of poverty
yet this is a very good day for the european parliament as we are expressing our opinions on issues of the utmost importance to the european union
for example the resolutions dated june and october are in that spirit
the commission cannot support amendment no since it intends to retain responsibility for assessing this programme
this it is achieving for example by adopting an inverse burden of proof for banks which will no longer be required to check with the utmost rigour to what extent a borrower is able to repay the credit
thank you commissioner for that very good and exhaustive reply
we should therefore strengthen all agrienvironmental measures along these lines

the danger in some of parliaments proposals lies in the fact that they go only half way and would make it harder for european agriculture to operate on the world market and achieve the competitiveness that is essential for our longterm survival

if they do not want to do it what measures will be taken against the isps
setting the date at is therefore to be welcomed
over the last year and more we have made it clear to our interlocutors in iran that we want to develop a sophisticated comprehensive relationship with them which recognises that iran is a great preislamic civilisation which recognises irans enormous geostrategic importance in the region and indeed in the world and which recognises that the outcome of the debate on democracy in iran is important not just for the region but for all of us

the corresponding contracts include feasibility studies development of the actual central system support and quality control the stesta network preparation for operational management in strasbourg security preparations in relation to biometric matters and communication
this is what we can do in the immediate future
fourthly we think that the money must go primarily to those who need it most and in our evaluation work we have found from talking to young people and agencies on the spot that it is those who know the situation best who are often best able to benefit from the funds available
in practice such aid has not cost the eu anything in recent years
the dynamics of cooperation and the anticipated benefits for both sides alone are sufficient to justify the new endeavour
do you know whether there are any indications that the legal situation will be adjusted accordingly
on a point of order mr president i recognise that i have not been called to speak but what mr allister said about discrimination against protestants in the police force in northern ireland is totally untrue
why not palestine or morocco tomorrow
therefore i have no hesitation in saying that i value my opponent mr cox on a personal level and even that i welcome the courteous relationship i enjoy with a number of fellow meps on the right including their main representative mr poettering
therefore the igc in amsterdam is absolutely crucial so that we can return to the sort of agenda that people understand
we simply have to increase both sides level of confidence in the system

or if a policy that is particularly hostile or particularly favourable towards a country or group of countries is promoted going against the ageold traditions of some diplomatic services or the vital interests of some members
i am working very closely with commissioner piebalgs whose involvement in the preparation of the security and development strategy is essential to ensure the necessary resources for its implementation
the proposals indicate we have the will to do the job but the resources must follow
this could deliver savings of up to eur million
i am speaking in fact as chairman of the committee on civil liberties justice and home affairs since mrs in t veld has already spoken on behalf of my group
it is in fact important that the candidate countries be involved
similarly with regard to amendment no the committee does not see the need to specify a period of three years as indicated in article of the proposal or the reason why the amount of the premium set in the rules should be changed
the appearance of evernewer media is a positive development
the fact is that we do not have a single document explaining how dismantled and dissected lamps can be recycled in such a way that their components can be reused

that is not on believe me
we welcome this
you have contributed really constructively together with the czech presidency to helping us reach this compromise at the end of the day

indeed the volume of printing has recently even gone up
the commissioner will now make a statement on behalf of the commission
everything is pointing to this threatening direction
i also support the objectives contained in the motion for a resolution that has been tabled in which the emphasis is placed on attitudes towards leghold traps
firstly we are right to demand that hamas should face up to reality and renounce violence but that must not be licence for israel to continue with its policy of unilateral violence which is what we have just seen it engaging in
do we really want to dedicate ourselves to a centuriesold european creation or to a business ideology that is a few decades old
but then what
however the commissioners attention should be drawn to the fact that the issues addressed in the reports by both mr di pietro and mr costa may be a step in the right direction but they cannot be seen as a daring step
we thus have a basis and a muchneeded impetus to start negotiations so that an agreement can be reached on climate change
yet this would have meant i am on the point of concluding madam president that we would not have managed to approve these agreements on the two countries
similarly the resolution of the cyprus issue is a prerequisite for any progress in the accession process
the auditors have rather found cases of technical irregularities which normally result in a refund to the eu budget anyway or a late payment or incomplete paperwork which gets chased up later
we cannot wait until food and energy shortages in the world blow up in our face and then be surprised that people take to the streets
that in my opinion is hypocrisy it divests our entire policy of any credibility
member of the commission mr president the commission thanks mr duff for his report
the current level of suffering and health problems in cloned animals reinforces that claim
reproductive health is cheap costing eur or per woman per year
mr president by their deeds rather than their words shall you know them i agree with mrs schroedter that the case of grigory pasko will increasingly become a test case for whether or not russia is working towards the rule of law and thus an important test case for relations between russia and the eu
we all jointly decided that this had to be settled via the wto that it could not be allowed
the commission for its part totally shares this approach and will firmly commit itself to the process of drawing up the charter and of course mrs halonen we will communicate to the next commission your invitation to the commission to make specific proposals in this regard
the objective of this reform was clearly to open the sector up further to competition

mr president commissioner the pronk report contains a whole raft of measures which we really need to take and the convergence of social security and taxation is becoming a particularly important issue partly as a result of the introduction of the euro
this method must be given particular consideration with the imminent enlargement of the european union in the context of our discussions on the institutional question there are two key issues involved here
i would like to congratulate mrs rothbehrendt and the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy for the many suggestions made in their report which aim to improve health and consumer protection not least by providing consumers with more relevant information

madam president we have heard many complaining and indignant voices raised in connection with the hungarian presidency
we will decide later it is not necessary to decide that now
we no longer have that
i agree but i am afraid that in some cases the methods proposed reflect a somewhat conformist political and economic approach which is not centred on the most innovative and bold options open to the union today
it now seems absolutely crucial firstly to show clearly that we are dealing with treaty policies which are not policies prepared for the purposes of a strategy but operate over a longer time scale such as cohesion policy
not all the events of have deserved the same attention however
madam president i do not want to take up too much time unnecessarily but mrs mckenna made two points that i feel i have to take issue with
however we urge more radical reform of the overall budget
these highquality reception facilities will be one of the criteria on which the award of the european university label will depend
we still have three months of our presidency ahead of us and i know that there is a lot of work in store for us but i am confident that we will as we have done before resolve the important issues through good contacts and good cooperation
first we must consider that it is not a question of deciding whether or not to authorise experimentation on embryos but of deciding whether projects involving unavoidably destructive research can be financed by the european union in other words with money that comes partly from member states that consider the destruction of embryos for experimental purposes to be a serious violation of fundamental rights
i fully endorse the proposals that mr prodi has outlined here
expenditure on purchasing and renting buildings is one of the main administrative cost items of eu institutions
that does not surprise me mr president and i am very happy for you you are well worthy of it
at the same time these three new member states and i am partly qualified to speak here on the basis of my experience of the internal political discussion in my own country of austria must also prepare very thoroughly for this debate
if the scientific committee is unable to produce an estimate of the current biomass because it lacks sufficient information the sector must not be doubly penalised with a reduction of the tac on the previous year
this deviates from the principle that the opposition is entitled to one post
to our deep regret and certainly to our surprise as well it was the turkish side that did not do so
our instructions to you will be on the table very shortly

thank you mr baron
first of all could i call for more honesty in our approach to turkey
article a of the treaty on european union is concerned with the establishment of a committee of the regions consisting of representatives of local and regional bodies
to begin with the commission will look more closely at the costs and benefits of a binding initiative on the granting of concessions and will examine other measures that will enable us to deal with the problems at stake

have we been a bit slow and not keen enough on bringing out new legislative initiatives
we are invading the traditional sovereign borders of the member states a fact that cannot be ignored or played down
ultimately the same emission standards must apply to any plant which burns waste
i wish to take this opportunity to reiterate the june lists rejection at first reading in april
it is in fact perfectly right and proper that the court of justice should very often in the past and even when the facts of the case were different have worked on the principle that the issue of which legal basis should be decisive should be decided by reference to the objective of the proposal as a whole
anything else is contrary to the precautionary principle that we have propagated time and again in all other cases and is contrary to our repeated pledges to protect human health
we have an administrative system for ensuring the proper implementation of competition rules
mr president ladies and gentlemen our debate today is focusing on the dramatic situation in eritrea
mr president i certainly join in welcoming this announcement
in so doing it is paying scant regard to the mood of the member states and their residents
furthermore we have more votes there than the us
so no one need fear that our forestry stocks are being depleted
this has manifested itself in a great sea of grey and a giant cloak of smoke continues to lay waste to portugal especially the central and northern regions

today they are denied this right
that is why our group the group of the european peoples party and christian democrats does not agree with the amendments which contain lists of instances and categories of victims
in the field of administrative and budget management the commission has undertaken a vast programme of internal reform
is it not the obvious step to ascertain whether in this case of force majeure we could actually pay that out of the european budget
nonetheless a driving ban imposed by a scottish court is recognized in england
i am sorry to have to say mr president that with or without all your legal arguments this political manoeuvre appears all too obvious to me and whilst on the matter i would tell you that your reference to rule is completely unfounded in my view
the european union may be first in line with its contribution but the risk is that the impact of its aid will be lost in a complicated network of competing structures the united nations mission to kosovo the stability pact the g high level group for economic relations the office of the high representative in bosnia the special envoy for the republic of yugoslavia etcetera etcetera etcetera
the road too should and can become safer
i applaud the huge majority behind the joint resolution
i support the report but i think that to ensure a greater degree of consistency an analysis should have been carried out of the national markets in the states with less developed economies especially in new member states such as romania and following the results approximation measures to the developed economies should be put in place as this is a sine qua non condition for the construction of the european single market
in the next few weeks we must show that we are able to continue to lead in the fight against climate change and to build an energy policy for the future because we owe it to our citizens our economies and our partners around the world as well as to future generations of europeans
in recent decades europe has nonetheless managed to create what is perhaps the most consistent supranational grouping to be found anywhere in the world today

i strongly condemn the bilateral trade agreements which continue to put trade interests before health in defiance of an agreement signed with the world trade organisation
defence of the prerogatives of the european parliament before the national courts
they also include the possibility of sending an eu observation mission and there is probably no longer anyone who needs convincing of the need to do so
to my ears the word conquer has the wrong associations
i do not believe there is any justification for setting a date for the introduction of this scheme until the impact of eid particularly in relation to traceability and disease control has been assessed
it therefore makes sense it is obvious in my book to retain the first objective even for the enlarged european union in other words all member states old and new must exceed of the average per capita income of the present member states
what is missing is something to honour the memory of the victims of fascism in southern europe
declaration of financial interests see minutes
goldstone and his working methods are endorsed by countries such as egypt and pakistan and we know the state of human rights in those countries

the notion of a european identity must be based on acceptance of the truth about our past

we also hope to establish at the forthcoming european council a reflection group to help the union anticipate and meet challenges more effectively in the next twenty to thirty years
i am thinking in particular of the desire for liberalisation as proposed or sought by the commission
mr president in march you sent a letter to the governor of pennsylvania tom ridge about the death sentence passed on mumia abujamal and his planned execution
vicepresident of the commission madam president let me begin by saying that as everyone knows the common european visa policy has so far brought us tangible results with several third countries such as very recently canada and australia
in ending i want to assure you that our first responsibility is to our european consumers and that we want a just and fair deal for everybody
thus countries like denmark germany and in particular spain and portugal have reduced the capacity and the power of their fleets portugal and spain even exceeded the objectives set
in general we need research on latin america and a comparative study of europeanlatin american development bringing out both the common features and the differences between the two cultures so that we can base all our future measures on the findings
saying this is not insulting to turkey on the contrary it shows respect for its difference and its identity and for the pride of the turkish people
we must also provide our own training
however i cannot fail to recommend the danish model
the amendments also mean that the european parliament is involved in the drawing up and amending of the criteria by which certain gmms will be excluded from the directive
i would like to take this opportunity to recognise the work of other members of the european parliament for example mrs packs work in relation to womens rights in turkey which i think has been evidenced by both the experience and the expertise brought to our discussions and deliberations this morning

mr president just to reassure my austrian colleague i was in fact a member of the committee on international trade for the first two and a half years of this parliamentary term

secondly what checks is it making on the concrete implementation at national level of the directives adopted
therefore the commission is not worried about the possible contradictory effects to which the honourable member refers

we are not trying to encourage health tourism
in todays society with all its dangers all attempts to increase peoples security are wholeheartedly welcomed

the definition of price stability that the european commission and the european central bank used in their reports assessing fulfilment of the inflation criteria was contrary to the definition of price stability that the ecb applies in its monetary policy
fourthly respecting the integrity of georgias territory the lawfulness of the issue of russian passports in abkhazia and south ossetia should be reviewed in order to prevent a repetition of the transnistria scenario
however what should we do about peaceful protests where those very citizens simultaneously become victims of repression because of police and army intervention
mr posselt i would very much like to be able to tell you right now when the decision on the headquarters of the european police college will be taken but i am afraid that this is not an issue on which a quick decision can be made because the headquarters of this college is included in a package relating to a whole range of european agencies that has been the cause of great controversy in the eu
i would like to say one thing however which is that having spoken about germany which supported us and about the united kingdom i was glad of the support from italy which was not all that obvious on the climate change and energy package

however it is also fitting that parliament let its voice be heard it is essential that it let it be heard in order to protest and express regret as previous speakers have done at the fact that parliament will be the great absentee from this conference indeed since the beginning we had asked that we be permitted to consider a formula that would allow us to be represented and to take up the place we deserve due to the determination we have shown over the years in favour of this court and in favour of international justice for peace
you clearly do not believe the argument yourself that trade preferences can be used to promote prosperity and combat radicalism
i believe we should discuss our ideas on a future european directive and european company statute in detail and without pressure of time
this motion for a resolution which is in line with some proposals on economic governance currently under discussion sets out basic principles to be followed in future discussions and establishes key ideas to take into account
this is a technical report and the group of the party of european socialists thinks it right and proper that it has been separated from our political reports

ettl report
he said that without john hume there would truly have been no peace process and of david trimble he remarked that without david trimble there would have been no peace agreement

despite the fact that no resolution has been adopted there were significant votes the most important of which would appear to be that in which parliament opted by a large majority for a common foreign and security policy with areas of enhanced cooperation
mr president as draftsman of the opinion of the committee on civil liberties justice and home affairs on the kuhne report i should like to take this opportunity to offer mr kuhne my warmest congratulations on the exceptionally difficult process which he has been through in order to be able to find a compromise between so many opinions in such a strong and excellent report
as a final point i emphasize that the existing positive actions must be kept in place thank you for listening to me
the universal declaration on linguistic rights made in barcelona in is a good document to take into account and i believe we are working in the right direction
mr president these reports deal with very important issues and i compliment both rapporteurs
whether it is to operate simply as a centre for identification and the collection of information on existing rights a thing that would simplify procedures for all the likely users or whether it is to function as a body for the collective management of the rights associated with a given work is not clear
for a start my group continues to insist that this war be brought to an immediate end

we must be aware that every possible effort should be directed towards initiating the peace process which is unfortunately not being implemented although there have been moments of hope in recent hours and recent days
these proposals from representatives of the fisheries sector have been on the table for a long time and were designed to tackle the current economic and social crisis which has been exacerbated by the steep rise in fuel costs
i believe that it is in the interests of development policy for us to get right to the bottom of this scandal because the fact is that we have problems making people understand why we are providing more resources for development policy when after all times are hard at home too and when we cannot prove that the money is being put to good use
the next item is a short presentation of the report by mrs toia on behalf of the committee on employment and social affairs on social economy
the kind of compensation on offer is unfortunately mainly symbolic but it is an indication that their former plight is being acknowledged today also
the fact that our house is giving its assent to an agreement twice in the space of two months is a sign that we regard this country with its favourable macroeconomic data as an essential component of the community of free europeans
we will therefore highlight the objectives and principles that the eu must respect in relation to our energy partnership in particular reciprocity transparency openness and creation of an effective legal and regulatory framework
i am not sure whether specific linkages are desirable or feasible but i would argue that this is an inevitable connection insofar as chinas opening is strongly predicated on its wto accession which apart from frequently raised important issues like intellectual property rights involves also an overhaul of the chinese legal system with an emphasis on the rule of law
this like our rapporteur said is a practical solution to a practical problem
i fully support this
as regards implementation and followup i consider it very important that not only the commission but also national parliaments bear a major responsibility for this as it goes without saying that these expulsions must also be implemented effectively
mr cox please restate your proposal as the deadlines in rule must be respected
as we know this is a very difficult discussion a discussion which may easily block all other talks about what the european union budget should be like and what we have already learned from the current financial framework
a total of possible suppliers are in the market including a european company
at first glance these seemed to be reasonable under the pretext of ensuring safety and quality but they were in fact thinly disguised protectionism against competition from imports into the eu
the commission draft suggests threshold values for gmos that do not represent a risk to the environment and consumers and which can therefore be commercially cultivated in the eu
i will make the third and final point in english in order to get it across it has to do with competitiveness and football
in its report the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy has in fact come to a contradictory decision on the subject which i believe the commissioner has briefly addressed
i do so in the hope that we will see meaningful cooperation between member states in the eradication of violence and terrorism
and the second matter is the way of settling disputes or disagreements in the colleges of supervisors
for that we must all work closely together and stay in close touch as the task of recovery unfolds including of course with this parliament
the french socialist delegation has therefore tabled a number of amendments because it feels that the compromise is not satisfactory in its current state and that it leaves the door open to too many uncertainties with regard to the courts interpretation
mr president slowly and all too belatedly a common european security policy is in the process of taking shape one which though it leaves a bad taste in the mouth to say so is at it were being built on the ruins of kosovo
finally i would like to thank all those who have helped to make the pilot procedure which was thought likely to prove troublesome run smoothly so far
i believe that all these animals are creatures of god and deserve to be protected for that reason
despite the difficulties it is vital to remain committed to the changes needed to establish intermodal connections particularly for citizens and freight
together we must each play our part in reducing unemployment and increasing employment opportunities in europe
what we were able to avert in time then is happening today
my colleagues will speak on more technical aspects but i want to take this opportunity to thank the commissioner and above all to express my support for everything he is doing in this regard he was one of the forerunners and one of the first people to talk about climate change here in brussels
it follows that the main question to ask when assessing what came out of the committee for conciliation between the council and parliament is whether the goals we have set ourselves have been achieved the first of those being the improvement and harmonisation of professional drivers working conditions the second being improved road safety and the third the creation of fair conditions under which all interested parties compete
mr president when president sarkozy spoke in this house today he said that russia has met its obligations regarding the withdrawal of its troops to their position before august and he called for normal relations with russia to be resumed
the lobbying policy for the nabucco pipeline project which is also being pursued within this parliament can also be found in this report
there are certain things which cause concern pandering to national sentiments the high level of corruption barriers to foreign investment the abundance of oligarchs on the election lists and the domination of personalities not election manifestos these things are all a legacy of the soviet period
the council will provide an opportunity to assess the progress achieved during the term of the presidency in areas which we regard as particularly important
exchanges of information extracted from criminal records
therefore we support the chichester amendment in principle and will be voting in favour of it
this is the approach that i commend it is the approach i have embarked upon it is the approach i believe is going to achieve results and it is the approach i intend to continue with
it is not very responsible to say today let us wait
we have to prevent criminal responsibilities from being blurred
this is the only measure which can play a crucial role in facilitating change so that the roma can be integrated into the labour market and escape the vicious circle of social exclusion
this among other things is about making use of transitional periods and about specifying the conditions of passenger transport services
this model should be developed in order to safeguard social standards that are attractive to the rest of the world
today i would like from here to send three messages
in recent years we have noted with some concern that legislation on asylum has been tightened up this has resulted in a downward trend in the number of applications for asylum in the european union and stagnation in the rates of acknowledgement of refugee status in many countries despite the fact that the human rights situation in the world has not considerably improved
additional funds should allow for effective quick and fair compensation for victims of future oil spills
in other words the proposed elements have been introduced to improve system efficiency and to ensure the optimal protection of marine biodiversity
in my view this will not create any new jobs
mr president i voted for the entry of hungary into the european union
for example next week we have a meeting the united nations
i believe that cooperation between associations schools and public authorities is very important
we realise that these coordination procedures exist and as a european politician i would actually be pleased if some people people in positions of responsibility politicians would coordinate their activities
the judgment of the international court of justice on the separation wall built by israel the refusal of that country to comply with it the feeling in diplomatic circles that the quartets road map is on the brink of failure and the protests from palestinian groups at the corruption in gaza are just some examples of these steps backwards
in future we want these resources to benefit those who really need them that means the fishermen whom we must help financially so that they can diversify their activity and have a chance if that is what they want of getting out of fishing
so is the case with the french and the socialists who were their cheerleaders
madam president my group welcomes this excellent and important report and congratulates the rapporteur
there are elections which are free and democratic
this has been justified with the argument that genuine knowledge is attained using precisely the objective methods and logical discussion which come less naturally to women than to men
the next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on tibet plans to make chinese the main language of instruction
the danish social democrats reject an informal euro x in which only countries which are in the third stage of emu may participate
the essential components are provided for in parliamentary consultation
what must not happen is that you begin by undertaking an amendment of the eurovignette directive and apportioning external costs to hauliers but take no action to ensure that operators of barges trains etc also meet their external costs

it is years since the idea of an internal market was put on the agenda
the direction we must take is that of increasing payments and simplifying procedures
our group will not therefore support the year moratorium
i shall therefore refer firstly to the new and auspicious political situation we are seeing in angola where finally following decades of war peace seems at last to be irreversible
it is therefore exclusively mrs doyle whom i shall thank for her splendid but it has to be said entirely fruitless efforts
there can be no reservations in declaring that its outcome was excellent both parties maintained a commendable constructive spirit across the whole range of issues discussed
information and communication
i also believe that the role of teachers in the information society must assume far greater importance than is accorded them in the white paper
i furthermore believe that it was right to leave the guidelines unchanged because they have on the whole been successful
the existing regulatory framework therefore requires an indepth revision and thus the efforts of the basel committee to upgrade the framework in general are to be welcomed in particular with uniform clear and transparent regulations
there are therefore good grounds for us to believe that we can really influence events in belarus
if a clause is added to paragraph in the resolution that a delegation is to go to kuwait then the issues of local government will also need to be addressed as well as the procedural issue because it is extremely awkward if such an important bill were not to be passed due to a procedural error
it is a clear and unambiguous rendition of one of the fundamental principles of eu integration the principle of supremacy which even mr racks students will be able to enjoy reading
thus we express our concern about the effects of rapid technological innovation on some areas of research especially in relation to the information society as regards the composition of the applicant groups as well as their launch and budgetary obligations
this proposed directive is most welcome within the european union
however my call is also to regional and local authorities to make the most of the opportunities that the structural fund offers to invest in infrastructure with regard to both efficient use of water and prevention of adverse effects when protecting water resources
the reason they are difficult is that israel is a friend that many of us and this is particularly true of me feel bound to the country by ties of deep friendship
the current wording of the treaty is fairly negative each country is given the right to take its own decisions but we have a single european market and so it is not really possible any longer for each country to reach decisions in isolation without that having repercussions so perhaps the wording of the revised treaty or the communication which the commissioner has announced might provide something rather more positive than we have at present
i am delighted to inform you that a delegation from the maldives parliament is present in the official gallery
at first reading it must quite frankly be acknowledged we were more ambitious now however partly as a result of the action of certain groups the legislative process has in fact caused us to scale down the project as first conceived in committee and then in this chamber
i can tell you mr rack that the return of illegal and other immigrants is an open question and i cannot say whether it will be formally tied in to the economic partnership agreements the commission is engaged in negotiations on the subject
that is why i feel that we members must be bold and demand a political response to the current impasse during the conciliation procedure not accounting tricks or half promises which are unworthy of our responsibility
this is therefore an extremely significant goal to which we attach a great deal of importance and progress towards which we are monitoring extremely closely
as the time allocated to question time is at an end questions nos to will be answered in writing
as i have also experienced at national level there is a steady rise in the number of admissible complaints but the increase in the inadmissible complaints is even higher

in a truly mature relationship with latin america these topics too must be discussed
the donnelly report has not been amended by our colleagues

fortunately the latest report conducted by azti and the juvena study have shown us that there are much greater anchovy stocks for the coming year

the commission and member states must take the necessary measures to guarantee this provision for processing biometric passport data both at the border and during the process for maintaining the relevant databases in the situation where national legislation contains this provision
firstly there is no need
a commission spokesperson argues that this is contrary to the letter and spirit of the agreement on the european economic area but in fact it is the dumping faced by community producers which is really contrary to both letter and spirit
it regrets that a recently planned mission to aceh by political councils from several embassies was cancelled at the last moment by the indonesian authorities
regardless of the fact that the european parliament was unable in the end to pass a resolution on iraq the way in which the majority of meps voted on the individual amendments is indicative of how it is dealing with this new demonstration of imperialist barbarity
i hope that commissioner oreja who is not here today and commissioner bonino who is here among us who are both people of culture will understand what is at stake here and on behalf of the european union will set in motion the necessary mechanisms so that the people of lisbon and its city hall and our friend and former colleague lisbons mayor joao soares when rebuilding that city hall can note that once again europe was with portugal
madam president i would particularly like to think commissioner kinnock very sincerely for all his understanding and patience when taking part in negotiations here and in always keeping to the law
mr president firstly i should also like to congratulate the rapporteur mr capoulas santos on his magnificent work
in europe the reduction in supply to keep prices at a decent level is being undermined by the actions of largescale wine manufacturers who are offloading their surplus products at low prices and thus grabbing the spare market

the swedish conservatives have today voted in favour of mr elless report on the budget the commissions report on the annual policy strategy

at the european council of and march the european union firmly undertook to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least by as compared to
that is all the more true in that todays books will of course become the collective memory of the next generation
wonderful papers are produced on active ageing
the more states that are involved the lower the cost of complying with kyoto will be
above all in health and safety we need to have uptodate scientific and medical evidence to demonstrate the need for such legislation
i believe that the perceptions of our european citizens are accurate
had the council been here i would have liked to have asked them for a guarantee tonight that they will do everything possible to reach a common position before the summer because this situation is incredibly urgent
unfortunately i fear that the proposals made are not up to the mark and in particular they encourage some member states to manage all alone when europe is unable to coordinate
mrs fontaine has emphasized the importance of the role played by the standing committee of european doctors and of the comitology procedure that is to be applied
mr president i would call for the vote on the accession of romania to be adjourned in accordance with rule
there are plenty of reasons to fear that whatever happens this allocation will be insufficient to secure economic and social cohesion
thank you commissioner
admittedly it vaguely threatens to censure the commission in cases where the latter might genuinely go too far
we will prevail in global competition only if we can bring efficient innovative and intelligent technologies to the market in a transparent manner and without bureaucratic obstacles
i would also add that i listened carefully to your concerns on my last visit to parliament
in the future we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place
if you adopt them the council has committed itself rapidly to adopt the whole agreed text and the programme should then be able to enter into force by january
why should it be abandoned
we can as we said ask that it be included among the silk road world heritage sites
emu has not been a protection
we also share the concerns referred to in the report about the situation in certain countries as regards the rights for example of asylum seekers women and children and in connection with minority languages
it was always ridiculous to suppose that a government having trouble paying its bills could be punished by imposing a fine yet as the european central bank points out sound fiscal policies are vital for the euro
they control only part of economic activity with the rest having been taken over by parallel or mafiacontrolled economies which profit from the financial aid given to their countries by the international financial community
i have already referred to the setting of temporary mrls as leading finally to the achievement of the single market in this area
we in europe must affirm our commitment to a multilateral approach in other words to the united nations
this is above all a service for them and i stand before the representatives of the citizens of europe to make my commitment to see this service fulfil your ambitions
we know that it is worthwhile to link policy on the environment with that on health
it has its own parliament its own currency its own president its own foreign minister its own external borders its own flag anthem passport and driving licence
mr president commissioner i find that i can sleep well next to a german french or british nuclear power station
application of this plan should make it possible to find a solution in the council of ministers which also includes reconverting the atlantic fleet which comes to less than boats including the british irish and french ones
but now a new and hopefully better government is on the horizon which may change this situation and contribute to ensuring that europes taxpayers see some return on the money they have sunk into the earth
the commission is preparing an initiative to further entrepreneurship education in europe
one way to achieve these objectives is to select projects of common interest and it is a priority in our amendments and one which we insist on keeping that an order of precedence should be established
we must always remember that europe rose from those bitter ashes on the basis of values of peace and tolerance
i therefore have the impression that working on the basis that this parliament is going to approve the proposal presented to us by mrs wallis by a large majority once it has been approved we are going to have to carry on working in this field
these two failings have forced us to shift down a gear and to adopt temporary transitional measures
mr vanhecke i would ask you to keep to the subject of our debate
what we have heard from the presidentinoffice of the council and from mr van den broek leads me to conclude that they agree with me
new european agencies and authorities are at present just as unnecessary as new internal market rules
the interreg initiative launched in to prepare the border regions for a europe without borders and therefore without nations sits comfortably within this philosophy
annex i of our rules of procedure article paragraph states that before a member may be validly nominated as an officeholder of parliament he or she must have duly completed the declaration of financial interests
this is rather unusual i know but it is a practical point
in the absence of mr agnoletto can i move the oral amendment to paragraph on his behalf
tour operators should be required to indicate which airlines are providing the flights
my group tabled the amendments in conjunction with the socialist group in order to fight now to achieve this important objective mr brie
consequently despite having voted in favour of some specific aspects i have in the end voted against the report because i wish once again to adopt a position of principle at a time when institutional reform by autocratic methods with the convention at the very centre appears to wish to develop in a very negative way and balance in the context
we have to focus on renewables
the findings of the european parliament will be taken into due account in the report to be prepared by the commission
recognition of island status in the treaty would be the basis for putting right the structural disadvantages of some regions which are different of promoting their sustainable growth of maintaining and encouraging local selfdevelopment and finally without prejudice to the continental regions of achieving an equilibrium between economic efficiency social equality and environmental conservation
the report highlights a number of important issues which i welcome
parliaments firmness and the negotiating skills of rapporteur philippe monfils worked the miracle of forcing the council to abandon its undemocratic arrogance and come to the negotiating table
no mrs maes we isolated the phrase we voted in two parts and both parts were approved by the house
chemicals are manufactured and traded on a global basis and their hazards remain the same wherever they are used accordingly it is appropriate that the classification and labelling of hazardous substances be suitably harmonised
we set too much store by the principle of hope and too little on hard facts as far as enlargement is concerned
despite this reservation the report contributes to consumer protection in the eu and i will therefore vote for its adoption
i share your concern
we very much welcome the result of the conventions work and the proposal by the convention praesidium which clearly requests a move towards the communitisation of europol with the incorporation of europol into the first pillar the europol convention being replaced with a council decision
a new treaty that is going to double the scope of parliaments codecision
however i believe that it makes sense psychologically to release them in a crisis but i admit that we could argue the point
several have attempted suicide
mr president perhaps the minister who comes from a country at the other end of europe was wondering why a member of the european parliament should be taking up our time with the subject of a family which the turkish authorities are not permitting to return to the occupied part of cyprus
therefore i say it is not an ideal situation but we have made a great step forward
on behalf of the ppede group mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i welcome the statements made today by commissioner almunia i believe that these statements also largely meet with the consent of my group
it was not easy to create the opportunity for this but it is also not easy to create the harmony between the requirements and the possibilities in the budget
however if some of the amendments are accepted particularly those presented by the ppede group we would consider the report to be stripped of its value and to have become an inconsistent document lacking in rigour and in that event we would reconsider our support
the commission will study this very closely and carefully and in this respect if it is decided to open negotiations those points will continue to be monitored very closely after these negotiations have started
while here we are discussing whether or not we want an open coordination method the debate in the streets focuses on the more than fifteen deaths there have been off the italian coasts on the endless people bodies which appear on the coasts of the south of my country on situations such as sangatte which the european public find truly exasperating in two ways on the one hand because we find this situation distressing and on the other because the prevalent feeling seems to be that we are facing chaos a situation of insecurity which is out of control
rutelli on behalf of the eldr group to the commission
this is not according to the rules but could i ask you mr presidentinoffice to take two short and i emphasise short questions from mr schulz and mr lambrinidis nothing more as we could discuss this for another two hours
the energy community should be expanded
where an alternative exists a substitution plan must necessarily be submitted if no alternatives exist at the time of authorisation the company must in all cases declare the lines of research and development that it intends to pursue
in my view the politicians in the member states whose civil servants have shown such resistance to the proposal cannot possibly justify to the public why their country is resisting a commission proposal which could make life easier for hundreds of thousands of their microenterprises and small businesses
for this reason we have to show our firm support for the united nations general assembly resolution on freedom of religion
we must therefore take into account maximum residue limits for pharmacologically active substances in foods of animal origin including meat fish milk eggs and honey
these two reports deal with issues both large and small
in the kirilov report we are choosing the second of these two options
i too have the impression that the transition process in tunisia is headed in the right direction
i voted for the pse amendment to paragraph in the vote
therefore i call in my report for specific measures to reduce the amount of bureaucracy at european level because we are responsible for this
the spate of mergers takeovers and transfers that we are experiencing with the deepening of the market means that we must act to update the matrix of information and consultation directives that we have adopted in the past but we must also complement them with the new general framework of information and consultation and an updating of the works council directive
the commission has therefore launched a number of initiatives in this regard and i am happy to answer the question by the honourable member of parliament
two firm principles are needed
any other approach would be ridiculous just as ridiculous as many of the speeches from many of the people who if they are here at all are hiding behind their brightly coloured flags
it is not a question of david versus goliath as mr gemelli said it is a matter of what the legal bounds of the commission are
this is the view held my most members of the group
securing the right level of payment appropriations for the ec budget is especially important and i am sure that all members will be aware that national budgets are so tightly constrained
we want to make the abmabb management tool better not extend it over two years
finally the annual work programme should come to a vote here in parliament
seen in that context it is really mindboggling that japan to name but one example should fund of the cost price of un peace operations yet has no say in the decisionmaking process not quite a democratic way of going about things one might say
i want the united kingdoms presidency and the years ahead to be a time in which we build on these achievements and further strengthen the european unions influence and power as a force for good in the world
i believe it is proper at the end of each presidency for the presidentinoffice of the council to come to parliament to give us a final assessment of that presidency
no one is forcing the manufacturer to comply with the technical specifications
perhaps however we will have the answer to this later on
the committee on external economic relations has focussed its attention on these problems which the rapporteur has largely ignored
however the opponents who are demanding a little flexibility in the rules especially at this time of austerity and saying that the switch to enriched cages or noncage systems will cost the poultry sector a nonbeneficiary of direct aid from the common agricultural policy a huge amount of money are also right
i would like to focus parliaments and the commissions attention on an amendment we are tabling which relates to extending the powers of uclaf to the control of other institutional bodies of the community as well
it is therefore right that particular attention should be paid to the rural population that practical measures falling outside the sphere of rural development should be adopted and that the preservation of farming should be encouraged and supported given the importance at local level of farms production must also be geared towards sustainable and highquality development
admittedly within the framework of the debate on the future of the european union we must carry out an indepth examination of the institutional setup the role of each institution and the amendments that need to be made to the treaty so that our union has a genuine institutional framework that is both more democratic and more effective
in april for the first time bucharest was present on all media channels only in a favourable light on the occasion of the nato summit that took place in romania
well done for the financial commitment provided that it is adhered to of course
moreover i believe that as time goes on it will be quite natural to make much more stringent demands upon the content of training
it will not be a platform for reading out writtendown statements the media will be present and i hope that we can demonstrate that europe benefits from debate
i therefore question whether a further assault on state aid is justified in pursuit of the failing lisbon agenda
another very big success was the fifth action programme on research
the people have been duped misled and treated with contempt
mr president mr commissioner ladies and gentlemen food additives have a particularly important role not only because they are significant to quality and price but because they are important to the consumer
we need first to put this into context
ladies and gentlemen we cannot accept the following amendments amendment no which proposes using noise measured at airports as a basis rather than the certified noise of the aircraft because that would significantly reduce the transparency of the charging system and also because it could cause discrimination as a result of the considerable differences between the noise measurement systems used in the different airports
let me say straight away mr president that we approve and endorse the commission s programme however we have formulated a number of reservations the same reservations formulated by the commission itself as regards the inadequate evaluation of programmes and more general shortcomings in relation to the threat which actually exists
i am pleased about that provided that in return for these new prerogatives the union becomes a new source of funding for space
captain camara and the coup leaders need to understand that the eu expects certain basic standards of governance in return for a tradeandaid relationship
the time has come to put an end to such waste
preparing a budget is never an easy process even less so during an economic crisis
i would like to speak for longer because this is a very big issue and many questions were asked but i would like to thank you again for your contributions
a strategic alliance was formed between the catholic kingdom of hungary and the balkan nations especially the serbs and albanians which later included wallachia too
on these issues which are new or which involve new aspects although some of them have been around for many years we have to say that they are risks and threats of a different kind to those that we have experienced before
in one section of the bank sector the plan is now being put forward to set up a new system for crossborder payments and that proves that the present proposal for a regulation is also realistic
i have heard commissioner verheugen use the term zero tolerance and i find it an appealing one
mr president honourable members ladies and gentlemen let me start by thanking mrs stihler for her report
we also deplore the illtreatment of mr anwar ibrahim in detention as well as the arrest of a substantial number of anwars supporters also under the socalled internal security act
moreover it is some consolation to learn that only part of these complaints were considered to come under the remit of the european ombudsman because a large proportion of the complaints not taken up by the european ombudsman were transferred to other bodies including the committee on petitions which i chair
it is the future of alstoms employees in france that is at issue
it is necessary to enhance the danubes cultural environment by promoting cultural dialogue supporting university exchange programmes and youth projects based on transnational cooperation fostering sustainable tourism and protecting the historical and built heritage
it was a joint effort and the success is also shared
nothing could be more common in our everyday lives than a mobile phone a television set or the ability to communicate
i would simply emphasize the point in the question that is that the anxiety to ensure that the smaller states in southern africa where there are economic costs be identified and that those identified costs be specifically and expressly addressed in any final agreement
it would be in the environments best interests to combine a harmonised market with ambitious targets
the ratification of the treaty of amsterdam will certainly help us to do that as we will have firm legal bases that establish mainstreaming as a fundamental and horizontal objective
i think we can improve the text but i am afraid that parliament will ruin it if it supports the opinion of the committee on economic and monetary affairs and i hope that the vote tomorrow will enable us to make the necessary adjustments
in return europe will have access to israels research and research programme
i would also thank most sincerely all those fellow members who have significantly helped improve and supplement my previous reports i would thank in particular my colleagues not only in the committee on foreign affairs but also in other bodies of this parliament for their often pertinent comments and suggestions
in addition it is not the relationship between the convicted person and the third party which is important but the fact that illegally obtained property was transferred to a third person
finally i should like to suggest that using rice as food aid is a dangerous and pernicious approach since the effects of destructuring on the economies of the developing countries of a food aid which is not suited to their eating habits on the one hand and which furthermore does not permanently take the place of local products
in fact safety should come first
i know that he is as disappointed as i am that the social affairs committee did not see fit to include in its resolution for example the view of the economic committee that the annual report from the commission on employment in europe should in future be referred to as the annual report on unemployment in europe
it was created under the media international action which since has focused on the development of the european unions relations with the audiovisual markets of third countries
taking into account however the agencys overall role it should maintain a high level of competences in order to perform its mission in monitoring evaluations proposing recommendations and conducting specific market studies
and from the beginning of next year this information will be supplemented by an indication of the place of birth and the place where the animal was reared
i particularly welcome the proposals for multilateral efforts under un supervision to get intensive diplomatic talks under way between the us and iraqs neighbours
i would therefore argue as a matter of principle that asylum seekers should not be detained
thirdly we must build on the montreal protocol as far as the export of gmos is concerned and this should be done on the basis of mutual agreement and transparency
we must ensure that we always refer to the constitution that grants more rights to our citizens to the citizens of europe

does the council find them helpful in order to convince the european citizens of the single currency
the annual report contains many examples of the institutions taking prompt action to settle cases brought to their attention and responding positively to my proposals and recommendations
while we were talking about the report on the european development fund he advised me not only to vote for it but also to ask parliament what happens to the funding for development for we know that the money invested in the development of the regions of southern italy for example has left brussels and strasbourg but has never reached the european citizens of sicily calabria or the regions of southern italy or the european citizens of many other regions whose development is lagging behind for that matter
annual report on the cfsp

we used to talk about more flexibility within the labour market with greater legal protection you are now talking about deregulating that protection
this is a question which cannot be evaded but it goes beyond the scope of this debate
however we must also see the other side
but ultimately it is the penalty regime that matters and that i suspect will test the commissions resolve
mr sacredeus has raised an issue which it is for neither the council nor the council presidency to comment on the organisation of popular consultation at national level and therefore the competence of member states
the fact is that that objective is now within our reach
i also hope that the european union can give its stamp of approval for it is up to europe to put an end to this phenomenon
finally we need governments of the left which look to change and not to large unacceptable coalitions
the european union has to use more environmentallyfriendly means of transport
mr president the union has recently set itself ambitious targets in keeping with its resources
it cannot be acceptable for multilateral environmental agreements such as the kyoto protocol to lose out
in addition a recent study indicated that there is no lack of alternatives to oestradiol for therapeutical or zootechnical use in the community
lastly a word of caution about the question of information
i welcome commissioner kinnocks statement but he knows as well as we do that it has come far too late and it really should not have been necessary
i do not actually favour the european arrest warrant but at the very least minimum guarantees have to be put in place before any more legislation is agreed by the european union
the intellectual rights of creators are deemed to be property to be taken away and bought like a commodity
the eurostat figures were also published this morning
i wish the next presidency luck in reaching an acceptable and balanced agreement indeed someone has already mentioned balanced agreements taking into account mr boges report which was adopted by a very large majority of your parliament
madam president enlargement and its strategic political and economic consequences for the european union cannot remain issues undiscussed by the public or viewed exclusively from the national perspective
this proposal to retain risk weighting in the union and extend it to all the member states is indexed to the economy it is justified by a whole range of safeguards against risk and raises no problems as regards the rules of competition
over and above procedural issues parliament and the commission share the same point of view on the need to include sectoral policies within the constitutional treaty
furthermore the slow progress in extending majority voting in the council undermines the core of the process of integration of the union and represents a serious threat to the actual decisionmaking capacity of the european union
the main problem is that the commission and the council do not supply parliament with documents from the phase during which legislation is prepared
the same applies to alcohol the strategy which i shall be presenting within the coming year will have a special dimension for young women
in order for transport capacity to recover the underlying problem has to be solved
we take the current and future problems of pensions policy and social change very seriously
the proportional list system leads us to the kind of partitocracy in which most members are no longer representatives of the people but instruments of the party functionaries
i fear that we have not moved on from that original racetrack image from the picture of a car churning up clouds of dust as its engine roars but unable to head towards the finish because it is immobilized in the pits
it is also referred to more generally as the sealing off of towns and villages on the west bank incursions and bombings targeted assassinations and mass arrests which include children further colonisation and building of the wall annexation and policy of the fait accompli in jerusalem etc
we share a common fate in our region when it comes to security in the region and numerous other issues such as the economy and political cooperation and as we have announced repeatedly we are committed to resolving the middle east conflict
i shall not dwell on what the main priorities are as they have already been mentioned terrorism requires a broad nonemergency prevention and reaction strategy which must certainly respect peoples fundamental rights personal data protection initiatives will be formally submitted very soon and in the second half of the year there will also be a comprehensive data protection initiative under the third pillar as i promised this parliament
i congratulate mr watson and all concerned in putting together this report
the representation rates for women are important because this helps encourage women to plan for a career in politics and to apply for a position with political administrative or financial responsibilities
i cannot understand the councils negative attitude towards the demand that more resources should be provided so that people who get the chance to be volunteers also get an adequate grounding so that they can cope with a new language
that is why i would also stress that in the period of transition from nice to lisbon we need to remain in close consultation with the european council as well if we want to avoid beginning the next term in a state of absolute confusion
no such measures were taken the council did not comply with this request
my mother tongue is one of those european languages that are spoken by one million people
i should like to take the opportunity to thank parliament and especially its rapporteur mrs weiler for their very detailed and inspiring contribution to the debate
furthermore the voices of the worlds poorest countries which enjoy completely free access to our markets as a result of the everything but arms initiative were not even heard this was because they were completely drowned out by countries which also claim to be underdeveloped but whose interests are fundamentally different from or even opposed to the interests of these poorest countries
ten years really was not enough
very well
it is obvious that the new context that we are living in today was not easy to predict years ago when it was being decided what was to be included in the maastricht treaty or years ago when the decision was made to launch the third phase of economic and monetary union
it is clear that we are facing problems and that adjustments will have to be made but improving our safety improving traffic safety improving security in ports is a necessity and an obligation which we must fulfil

ladies and gentlemen the statistics speak for themselves
mr president i want to thank mr spidla for his declaration and the fact that he intends to reform the european works council directive
without dwelling on any particular aspect of the financial services legislation to which this report refers i have to fulfil my own democratic responsibility and point out that the aggregation of community legislation is slowly but inexorably strangling the financial community and making it almost impossible to trade
it is not intended to prevent a specific form of medicine distribution such as parallel trade
lastly i welcome the announcement made by the commissioner that we will have legislation on citizens access to justice before the end of
the parliamentary group which is following this problem closely and tabling and gaining approval for various amendments has highlighted the issue of religious freedom we are concerned about the communist partys appointing of bishops it is like the vatican appointing generals in the chinese army it is incomprehensible and the freedom of so many chinese citizens is being violated
secondly we said in very specific terms that we will work closely with all member states in examining the situation as it develops in austria
direct control of the payments and how the funds are used is essential
i have received seven motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with rule of the rules of procedure
the information society should continue to be considered as services of general interest and investment in information infrastructures should comply with the principles of equality continuity and affordability so that market logic does not discriminate against the needs for access to information of peripheral regions and vulnerable social groups
we are therefore all in favour of multilateral rules but which rules and to benefit whom
i think this would be a considerable contribution to development in sustainable conditions
i believe that every crisis also offers an opportunity to be seized an opportunity to renew our european model of a social market economy and an ecological economy also it offers an opportunity to show europes strong desire to contribute to the wellbeing of its citizens
we already have polluterpays legislation in the past the polluter has only paid a fine but we have had a fundamental shift and now the polluter pays to clear up the damage that he or she has created
former ministers have been charged with corruption
today there was to be a meeting between the european union and ukraine the subcommittee on trade and this issue would be raised there too
i am now in the strange position of having written down several more points which all the previous speakers have already dealt with
european agricultural policy needs to be fairer and it needs to be fairer to the environment
it seems to me that the fundamental rights agency despite the conditions and the competencies that it possesses should base itself strongly on the charter of fundamental rights this should give it the clear understanding that it too is a guardian of the charter of fundamental rights also for those citizens those member states who have not accepted the charter of fundamental rights in full
also great in this regard are the expectations connected with harmonising systems of guarantees and legislative reform regarding mortgages which we are expecting in the committee on economic and monetary affairs
tanks were positioned at the bottom of the steps in nativity square blocking all access to the church
it is a question of passenger safety and fair application of the rules of competition within the european union

therefore we have to accept the commissions recommendations that we should proceed with five countries in addition to cyprus
less than a year ago we would have had to hold a very different debate

i would like before anything else to give my apologies in particular to mrs beres
the debate on capital punishment whenever they have one in the usa is about what form is more humane gas hanging injection or electrocution

whatever your views on this issue and whatever you can establish about it those of you who understand it and have access to the information know that there is no wolf
implementing a commission delegation in each of the countries would send out a strong political signal
it has basically been absent with no cohesion and no reflexes
the diverse climatic geographical and structural conditions in which wine grapes are grown in europe have to be taken into consideration
our task therefore is to provide information to refine things all the more so because the three instruments are tools for the priority areas but are not so within the context of the th category where there are projects which remain linked to the support for the european union s policy and therefore with traditional proposals
in other words it is also an attack system
the councils decisions have seemed doomed from the outset to a short life and marginalisation because they were no more than a patchwork of national demands and complex mechanisms
it is therefore even more urgent that we acquire and disseminate managerial and technological skills in order to promote new means of production and a supply of tourism which reflects market developments as closely as possible
the original proposal of the commission was for a cod and hake recovery plan based on scientific advice which was broadly similar in its assessment of the situation in both of these fisheries
lastly i leave you with this positive thought
the wrong answer to that has come from most governments and businesses over the last few decades they wanted to reduce the number of people entitled to pensions by inter alia abolishing widows pensions and by starting the oldage pension at an older age
mr president of the council the finnish presidency conveyed an important message to all europeans
obviously the credibility of the entire un system is at stake
the challenges facing europeans offer the eu an opportunity to demonstrate to citizens that they are more united more responsive and more anxious to protect them

climate change is causing desertification and increasing the incidence of extreme natural phenomena such as storms torrential rain and floods
uk conservatives voted today against the skinner report for the reasons given in my speech to the house the day before
as you know competition legislation in particular does not take account of these repercussions which are unquantifiable but we are making an effort and the commission has been at the disposal of employees and employers alike so that the best possible preparations can be made and we do not have thousands of people on the streets with no provision made for them
fabrications and speculations persist only in the absence of truth
as permanent rapporteur for the structural funds in the committee on budgets i have decided to ask the members of the european commission what the reasons were for putting of the administrative costs of these funds in reserve
by developing these housing projects we can tangibly improve the material circumstances of their residents and reduce the buildings energy consumption as well as creating and preserving jobs
this adjustment would create a level playing field for portuguese growers and would guarantee the sustainability of sugar beet production which in any case can and should be increased when the alqueva dam comes into operation
that is quite normal
i am sure that it is only me that thinks that the european parliament may well be applying double standards
these are some of the independent newspapers that i bought yesterday at the airport this is il manifesto a communist newspaper this is lunita a newspaper founded by antonio gramsci of the democratic partydemocratic party of the left and this is leuropa the newspaper of the margherita party which has joined the democratic party
i agree with the suggestion of chairman gargani that the importance of the mep statute is an issue that we should address
the second is if the country concerned does not recognise or does not implement fundamental principles that are crucial for the european union
one agreement has been reached on how much capacity is to be reduced
i strongly support the suggestion that the eu should step up its efforts to meet the target of of gdp investment in research and development indeed i wish to express my disappointment that my own country ireland has a much lower target
and i should also like to place on record in the report of parliaments proceedings the efforts of another lawyer this time european and german hans weil who from his position as chairman of the ccbe the legal professions representative body in the european union illuminated the debate with his intellectual honesty and rigour
i do not believe that they will
this is why i feel that we should now ask the scientific committee to conduct more detailed scientific studies taking the most recent data into account whilst at the same time waiting for the screening tests which could be applied to live animals and stepping up monitoring at all levels
this should in turn consolidate the indigenous reform process leading towards a more open society
however it is also showing the will to improve in many areas
the committee on economic and monetary affairs and industrial policy produced an opinion which sought to strengthen and modify where necessary the commissions draft directive our measures included the gradual and controlled openingup of the market
thank you but you will have to bring that up as an oral amendment during the vote tomorrow
these include the letter sent by the polish bishops to their german counterparts in autumn in which the former addressed the german people through the roman catholic bishops of germany with the famous sentence we forgive and we ask for forgiveness
this is also an area in which the trading of emission rights provides a means of achieving some stability in our efforts to reach the requirements laid down in the kyoto protocol
in my view the social status of posted thirdcountry nationals is and was adequately described in that directive
i wish to mention at this point that parliament will be sure to restore some balance to the proposals that have been referred to it in order to make the financial markets more robust
you are in charge of the european union and you are stopping the european parliament from having any further powers
for this purpose one should build on existing or adapted reporting mechanisms such as the charter implementation report which we have discussed here today
turning to the lisbon strategy let me say quite plainly that i find myself wondering whether this strategy for establishing a competitive economy throughout europe is just a matter of redistribution by way of the european budget or whether certain member states have particular tasks to perform i am thinking in particular commissioner of the country from which both you and i come and in which your party shares in the responsibilities of government
however no one must expect change to occur quickly
we have given the goahead for large multinational companies to plunder and play fast and loose with the worlds genetic resources
first and foremost however we need to establish a real dialogue with the parliaments mr baron crespo is right to say that parliaments are after all the prime representatives of public opinion that is obviously true
we cannot ask our ngos to go to places where the military say they will not be safe
clearly a broad view of human rights must be taken encompassing economic social and cultural rights in addition to civil and political ones and practical work must be done to foster the human and institutional conditions under which these principles may be achieved
my second question concerns what commissioner diamantopoulou mentioned regarding older workers
does it intend to promote any special measures to supply heating oil
the network of cooperation between the european ombudsman and national and regional ombudsmen throughout europe which comprises some offices in countries was strengthened and intensified in with four highlevel meetings in athens valencia warsaw and strasbourg
the simplest way would be to adopt fully unified criteria for each classification level and for all the member states
in other words israels occupation must be brought to an end or there will never be peace
if anyone had asked me at the time whether the country would accede to the eu at the same time as the other visigrad countries i would probably have said no
dawit isaak is a swedish journalist who has been imprisoned for freedom of expression
governments the commission the national parliaments and we in the european parliament must send a positive message to the citizens so that they support this constitution and if possible do so by means of a referendum
i should like to say something about the german market in answer to members who have made reference to that particular aspect
mr president the commission welcomes the support expressed for the common position
report caspary
but it is one which can lead to overfishing when applied to multispecies fisheries as you cannot obtain optimum levels of all species at the same time or when it is applied to pelagic species that dwell in deep seas and open water such as the north sea and the atlantic
this has resulted in a chronic status quo of mismanagement lack of enforcement and overfishing in the mediterranean sea
at the same time the council agreed to send another troika mission to rangoon
lack of respect for human rights and the rule of law in iraq is a matter of grave concern for the international community
what should actually be on the agenda then
it is simply unfortunate that the situation is now deadlocked for a number of reasons which i described in the committee on foreign affairs security and defence policy yesterday evening though these must not be seen as an excuse and must certainly not discourage us from continuing to try to improve the situation in our relations with turkey
where our future cooperation is concerned the absolute priorities in our relations with guatemala are still social cohesion rural and local development including the definition of a comprehensive food aid strategy and finally the advancement of the indigenous peoples
the committee also calls on the european commission to propose a directive on services within the framework of the internal market in order to deal with obstacles to the movement of workers and the provision of services
the council reaffirmed its commitment to implementing the financial services action plan and achieving fully integrated markets
the councils failure to put sufficient emphasis on this issue is something that i find unacceptable
however these extraordinary measures do not come free of charge they are accompanied by major requirements restrictions and threats of penalties for countries that are not capable of restricting spending and which could therefore also compromise growth
this is the only change and as i said it has been agreed with the rapporteur and so he accepts it
in our group as is inevitable different people take different positions on this
there us strategy has freedom of manoeuvre but if president obama listens to his hawks he risks another vietnam
i should however like to make a few recommendations
i do not believe that is the case
if the lamented lack of coherence should happen to have something to do with this point then i am bound to say that this regulation is a legal framework and nothing more than that
i think that all citizens of europe are entitled to this and that it would be counterproductive if it were not to happen
mr president commissioner spidla ladies and gentlemen to date unfortunately we have paid too little attention to the tragedy of europes roma sinti and other tribes
john hume the nobel peace prize laureate also attended our group meeting today and he stressed how important it had always been for him to perceive and acknowledge the differences in this europe of ours not just the differences between two sides but differences on the same side
i see this as watering down it is an omission not to clearly state that we utterly condemn such a terrible form of punishment
it nevertheless seems possible that certain member states will not make full use of their allocation this will impair the effectiveness of the grubbing up regulation
i believe it to be particularly important that they should now also lay down their weapons and cease from standing in the way of the countrys democratic development
the way to cut this spiralling increase in road transport and limit its negative consequences is to develop alternative forms of transport and in particular to strengthen shortdistance maritime transport by creating motorways of the sea and rail and inland waterway transport
in the meantime our beekeepers need help more funds to cope with this new crisis whatever its origin
of course opinions differ on the extent of the technical and economic potential for energy savings over the next five years but whether we aim for or higher the potential is still very great indeed
the second amendment has to do with a derogation from the information procedure for exports of gmos to a third country where this third country has already granted approval for release to another country in respect of the same gmo

paradoxically this mp has a friend who is disabled
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen president of the ebrd i welcome the fact that for the first time in your presence parliament is examining a report on the ebrd whose work reputation and credibility have clearly been consolidated under your presidency
above all with regard to the huge new bridge between sweden and denmark it is important that the money is used wisely and that this project is not favoured over other infrastructure projects which may be necessary
communication is very important and i believe that the european institutions must have a genuine communication policy
we welcome the positions taken by the rapporteur regarding the development of organ donation and transplantation in the eu the ban on any form of financial transaction between donor and recipient and on the commercialisation of transplants and the struggle against transplant tourism in countries where trading in organs takes place and the recognition that the trade in organs is linked with social inequalities
i also hope that turkey which is also a candidate country understands that a solution for cyprus is very much in turkeys interest and that denktash cannot insist on a two state model
i have read this report with more than the average level of interest
in all its forms terrorism defines the fight between good and evil and we must remain ever vigilant
we do not believe in europe as a political integration project
denmark and sweden apart the united kingdom has the lowest unemployment rate in the whole eu way below the average eu rate
to conclude from the two examples which i have just given you will understand why our group is using its vote to oppose any change to the community customs code which would lead to a reduction in community preference and in the role of companies and national authorities in the customs process
i would also like to insist on amendments nos and which my group would be prepared to accept as long as it is made clear that the word representatives refers to people chosen as such within each company and in no event to organisations whose participation would hinder and delay the process of adopting the system
that is why i have done my best here to give all the support needed for europe to overcome this challenge
mr president this is an owninitiative report on the interim review of agenda in relation to the second pillar rural development
i must also mention that in the light of these challenges after the cap must send out strong signals and provide answers to the concerns of both the rural community and wider society through a strong sustainable wellfunded credible and multifunctional food policy
so much so that in the final analysis the nation states themselves are revealed to be the only ones able to protect the people and their freedoms as required
the reasons for the push factors of asylum are deep and profound they are poverty and instability
only a few member states have made proposals to the commission
she was willing to make proposals in the second part and she also formulated suggestions for future policy
for example there is much potential here for economic restructuring in order to safeguard our own chances for the future
mr president we have heard a lot today about giving and giving and giving and cutting and cutting and cutting
we cannot do any more than is being done here and anybody who gives the impression that what we have done here does not provide adequate protection for children is i am sorry to say deliberately misleading the european public
we have to invest massively in these countries and also help to create public services that are accessible to everyone and to set up businesses that will pay their employees fairly which it has to be said is not always the case at present
never has the need for a permanent international criminal court been so glaringly obvious a court protected from all forms of pressure and one that will allow this type of situation to be handled in the best possible manner in future
it is based on the reports prepared by the commission one on each country which are also available to you
it is the european parliament
lastly i agree with the idea of setting up a european network of organisations and experts active in the field of gender budgeting to be linked into the network of parliamentary committees for equal opportunities this will allow the development and dissemination of good methods and practices
in the american neil armstrong was the first man to walk on the moon the voyager missions launched in have left the solar system meaning that astronomers will be able to discuss not only the outer reaches of our galaxy but the outskirts of the whole of the visible universe
on the contrary it has contributed to the loss of thousands of smallscale fishing jobs and to the social insecurity of fishermen without achieving convincing results with respect to the conservation of resources
we note in the motion for a resolution that this partnership is also the most important strategic partnership for europe also
israelis and palestinians have made substantial progress in implementing the sharm elsheikh memorandum
it is also true that the implementation of european court of human rights judgments is mandatory for all states that are party to the european convention on human rights and italy like any other party involved in this case has the right under article of the convention to request a transfer of proceedings to the grand chamber within three months of the date of the judgment
i have to tell you that of dangerous toys come precisely from europe
the difficulty is that president putin mr medvedevs predecessor said much the same thing at the start of his term yet we all know how things developed and what the present situation is like
the unions financial regulation lays down the principle of budgetary balance
commitment to the eus principles of equality and solidarity should end the existence of different standards and also prejudices in decision making
by way of contrast i would like to know whether we would organise debates in their current form if it were your money
what i want to say is if president saakashvili is suggesting dialogue with russia it is necessary for the other party to understand that this is a genuine invitation to dance
i would like to stress that the achievements of the commissions proposals will consist not only in the existence of the technologies themselves but also in opportunities to access them and opportunities and incentives for older people to learn in those parts of europe where this is of particular importance in reducing disparities in income levels and regional disparities
the group of the european peoples party supports this report and we congratulate both rapporteurs mr corbett and mr martin
at such a crucial time in the unions development we could not have found a better candidate
on behalf of the vertsale group mr president ladies and gentlemen it is true that the mass importation of counterfeit products does a great deal of damage to the european economy particularly to the production of quality goods and i am indeed in favour of doing something to address this
amendment no which we are retabling provides for the creation of a sectoral dialogue committee on all measures with social implications taken to implement this regulation
resolving these would give the member states of the association the opportunity to derive full benefit from the agreements they are signatories to
whether we need a fourth package or not will depend on the commission ensuring implementation and good policing of these new laws by national regulatory authorities and competition authorities
madam president the european union is a society of shared values
my practical question to the council is as follows did the united states exert pressure and demand that farc representatives visas be withdrawn before the eu decided to do this
mr president commissioner it has been a long road to the final decision on the european communitys fifth framework programme for research technological development and demonstration
i fully support the right of the palestinian population to selfdetermination and their right to defend themselves against the repeated attacks of the israeli army and state forces
that is why we are backing the amendment tabled by the rapporteur who rejects the commissions suggestion to revise and amend the guidelines by producing new white papers
mr desir i note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution
and we believe it is very important at this moment and this is the approach my group has taken throughout this debate and we believe it must continue to try to achieve a united and decisive european position in order to ensure essentially that the war is not inevitable and in order to achieve a disarmament process in relation to weapons of mass destruction in the case of iraq which takes place under international pressure under the auspices of the united nations
however in doing so they did not comply with the treaty
we all know what terrible suffering there was
so the combination of these two factors better performance of the systems on the one hand and lower execution so fewer payments effectively made on the other has given us the situation where we now are
indeed it would be detrimental if we gave the new member states the idea that despite their many sacrifices and despite the fact that the old member states welcome new markets with open arms we do not appreciate any extra competition
but i must move this on behalf of the committee supported unanimously by every political group in the committee on constitutional affairs
finally a number of additional points have been raised during this debate i assure you that i have taken good note of them and will forward your ideas positions and concerns to commissioner dimas who will certainly give them studied consideration
today therefore we find ourselves in a radically different situation to that of yesterday yesterday was the day the dream came true naturally i would not want us today to have to start picking up the pieces of a dream already shattered
last of all i think that max van den bergs point about rules of origin their improvement and simplification is very important
in any event the outcome is in your hands
and here quite rightly i think the report points out that firstly one such sector is information technology and the electronics industry a second sector and one of particular interest to my own country is tourism agritourism and more generally the leisure industry
after a controversial discussion of this point in the committee on agriculture a compromise proposal has now been submitted
in any case those diplomats were involved at every stage in finding solutions on behalf of their member states which makes them partly responsible for the results achieved in the convention
in the united kingdom a risk assessment has been initiated to ascertain the possible transmission of nvcjd through blood transfusion
my reply will be quite short the council has neither discussed nor adopted a stance on the issues brought up by mr sacredeus and therefore cannot answer the question
and for a great deal of expenditure that we have to set such as that to deal with surpluses it is worth asking if action is really being taken in the right area or if it would not be better to spend money elsewhere in the case of agriculture it might for example be better directed towards achieving objectives in the areas of consumer and environmental protection animal and landscape conservation and structural improvement in rural development
before submitting an appropriate proposal to the council on which parliament would be consulted the commission services are working on a full assessment of a joint european venture
i want to address the issue of shelter it is not at all a trivial issue because people actually do not want to move from where they are now
with both things
we therefore agree with the call made to the member states and the competent authorities to ensure that greater stress is placed on health development in school and preschool teaching programmes by encouraging specific forms of physical activity suitable for these ages and raising awareness within clubs and associations in order to ensure that children can start physical activity at the earliest possible age for the benefit of their development and health and hence to guarantee physical education status in accordance with the profile of the institution and the corresponding level of study
it has now been proved that europe is in a unique situation based on multifunctional agriculture and the familysized nature of its operations
mr boge has put forward a proposal from this house relating to the financial perspective and if you want the possibility of compromise i urge you to be guided by it

in recent days we have heard that mrs sanders has been trying to make the first reading suffice
now is the time to do something about this
what you have just discussed relates to events which go back as far as last july
i call on the commission to form an alliance with the european parliament and come forward with a roadmap for fundamental rights and equality based on the proposals in the zdanoka report
the european council welcomed the fourpresidency initiative led by ireland the netherlands luxembourg and the uk which will drive this issue forward as a priority over the next two years
my support remains for the original recommendations which will guide our future legislation and ensure europe plays a constructive role in tackling foot and mouth disease for the future
i would therefore urge the commission and not therefore mr patten but obviously mr prodi really to focus upon the desperation of the developing countries for this is of course the world s greatest problem today
how successful does the commission judge that the unions fiveyear strategy has been it runs out during given the flood of heroin and other drugs on our streets
just weeks after the vote on discharge information that the commission had withheld on the eurostat affair came to light
at any rate latvia the state i represent in the european parliament cannot talk about complete isolation since it has a common gas market shared with two other eu member states and a gas storage facility that supplies the region
the europe we are building is born of the bitter experiences we have all suffered and the socialist group condemns the insults which have been directed at the president of the french republic and the belgian government but also at the socialists who are european citizens as well because at the moment the austrian socialists are being described as traitors to their country
we also need a much more professional management of largescale projects and this is the separate part of the annex to the budget review the innovative financial instrument must go beyond the by volume of the european budget
the sitting is now suspended and will resume at pm
on behalf of the pse group mr president i do think we should wait for this parliaments delegation to visit georgia in a weeks time when it will look in particular at the abkhazia question
whatever happens we need a solution which covers the whole of europe
the bush administration does leave something to be desired though when it comes to the transparency of the detention system prisoners can be detained for years without the court intervening and it is also unclear in what ways they are interrogated

madam president ladies and gentlemen the issue for us is one of substance and not form
that being so i am not the least bit surprised at the depth and sincerity of the arguments put on all sides of this debate because any issue relating to the intellectual property area always generate this kind of argument and people who are on the opposing side of the compromise proposal put forward by mr crowley will be on totally the opposite side in other areas of intellectual property

but it is quite clear that the european parliament should propose bold amendments to the treaty of rome

it is always the same problem the member states lack the courage and the determination to implement the solutions that have been identified
if we listen to the commissioner and read the report we can in fact discern a picture emerging that is in keeping with recent amnesty international reports a combination of progress in some areas but ongoing problems in a number of others
within this framework the structural funds must be allocated differently
this will be the aim of the action plan and there is no doubt that we will deal with this problem of victim protection by taking account of what has been said during the debate namely the need to try first of all to make people aware of the tragedy and the suffering of victims who are often the subject of silence if not contempt

i do not know if anyone can say for sure that we shall achieve this objective
the eu failed especially in demonstrating a unified and efficient approach to climate change treatment as well as in strengthening its leading political position in this agenda
from my perspective it is also very important to safeguard copyright so there needs to be an agreement with the authors and publishers and everyone else involved so that for an appropriate fee the information can be put on the internet for people to access
i genuinely fear the outcome if war in iraq is followed by another year or more of violence in palestine and israel
transnistria is committing serious violations in the areas of democracy and respect for human rights
the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party will support most of the amendments
obtaining the best service for our constituents is i am sure in the interests of us all
let us not forget that a free press is the cornerstone of democracy
with its integrated structure the new service should help to ensure that human rights issues are reflected in all areas of our external action including csdp development and trade
the energy industry however is such a capitalintensive sector of production that not even additional funds will solve the problems eu countries have with regard to adequate supplies of energy the security of supply or energy saving and environmental protection
i think it is a great pity our amendment on this seems to have no chance because the germans in particular have not yet got this far and even the christian democrats will not support it
by making additional efforts it is possible to foresee the achievement of the objective and the trebling of the production of electricity from renewable energy resources by
on behalf of the ppe group mr president mrs schauvliege commissioner if we are to learn anything from copenhagen where you commissioner were of course president then it should be that the european union must speak with one voice at such conferences in future
finally to indicate the complexity of the matter and the panoply of instruments through which the commission which is particularly active in this area is addressing the problem i should mention that we have proposed two draft directives on the issuance of electronic money
mr president ladies and gentlemen for many years poland shared the distinction of being a leading producer of starch with countries such as germany the netherlands france and denmark
finally it calls for the employment policies that have resulted in a mediaeval labour market that have increased unemployment and underemployment that promote flexible forms of work and attack the wages and pensions and rights of european workers especially young workers to be continued
now though another motion is before the house to the effect that the invitation be extended to both commissioner mccreevy and the president of the commission
i would like to say however that we have learnt to live under these conditions and i believe that we will continue to live so long as we always know that the contribution of each of us is positive at whichever level it is made
i do not share these views because in terms of vehicle construction you know very well that it takes years to design and construct cars
has he read the duke of edinburghs criticism this week of the onesided nature of fishing agreements between the eu and poor developing countries
we tried everything to persuade the countries of this but they would not hear of it
this is about a financial system which will apply for quite a period of time
it has been stated in quite a few newspaper articles that the commission intends linking demands for liberalisation of services in other countries to a reduction in or removal of eu export subsidies in the agricultural sphere
nonetheless this report represents a small step in the right direction
the same is true of our neighbours in the east and in particular in a country which is an immediate neighbour of the european union belarus
i should like to highlight the negative contribution of the eu in terms of monetarisation and specifically the financial services action plan which encourages the deregulation liberalisation and integration of capital markets together with the dismantling of prudential rules and control mechanisms
there is broad support for our common approach a degree of consensus which is so crucial at the start of a new phase
at my primary school we had to learn several new songs
today only two common policies exist the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy
the truth is that this will have two harmful consequences one within the european union especially for the southern countries and for their textile and clothing industries which are now seriously weakened because of an economic social and financial crisis unparalleled since they joined the union and secondly at international level during world trade organisation negotiations where this opening of the largest trade bloc in the world the european union to these potential exports from pakistan could completely unbalance the negotiations
in my view the budget which is being put to the vote tomorrow shows that the committee on budgets thinks it important that we also try in future to create growth via the regions
cooperation with the united states to combat terrorism is important but not at any price
progress on these points will create a new context in which we can then decide what to do about the text
at a time when the net contributors do not have unlimited resources at their disposal and net recipients are keen to protect their vested interests it will be difficult to achieve a constructive solution
here too there is certainly greater agreement between the commission and parliament than between the commission and the member states
that is the main difference
i can only recommend to the ideologists of this house that they try to get in touch with those who work at the sharp end in the member states
if this spreads throughout europe it will mean control of the press
energy efficiency will have a huge impact on economic growth the methods used to cut co emissions and on creating jobs in areas such as it construction and services
the commission will decide on any necessary action once the responses are available and have been analysed
in this respect i think it is also essential to develop a common crossborder procedure for reaction and cooperation which would be put into action immediately if a leakage of crude oil occurred
behind the essentially peaceful facade tensions are rising which could explode given the right political situation
an increase in the receipts of some member states cannot be made on the back of the reduction of the receipts of other member states nor can it have the character of a correction
the explanatory statement of this proposal for a regulation emphasises the lack of specific community provisions as one of the principal reasons for this new regulation and i agree with that
we cannot for instance apply competition law in its purely economic sense if that would ultimately destroy competition in its sporting sense
to my mind there is something very odd going on when the basis of a report can be taken as read without thorough investigation
there can be no doubt whatsoever that sudan is an urgent situation even though we have discussed the tragic situation in that land on many occasions
i look forward to working with parliament on this and am pleased to be here today to give you this information and to hear your views
the world is becoming a smaller place in terms of market access and the term global village is not out of place
another point to which i wish to draw your attention is improved transparency
however let me say quite clearly that the principle on which the green paper is based is that any action relating to corporate social responsibility any corporate social action has nothing to do with compliance with current legislation which is taken for granted
but the lessons we have to learn from current events go much further than that
regional cooperation can also help ease the political tensions in the region
mr president before we start the debate on kosovo or mitrovica i must inform you that a nasty sense of unease has come over me
we and the acp states should note that
similarly we must also be satisfied with the favourable reception which the ombudsman has given to our proposal to draw up a common set of general administrative rules applicable to all the institutions and to all bodies of the european union in the form of an code of good administrative behaviour
we passengers believe that we must establish and defend our rights and manage our airlines airports flight timetables and air traffic control better
different services are expressing their opinions so it is at an advanced stage of internal preparation today
our hopes are centred first and foremost on the young generation in our countries
this report will provide a great deal of input into the final programme which the commission presents but in closing i must stress that i believe that any regional programme irrespective of how much funding it has if it is not applied within the framework of international agreements i repeat this because the approach on the european side is often considered paternalistic so i repeat that this programme will only succeed and bring in the results we all hope for if it is applied within the framework of international agreements the beijing declaration on respect for human rights and respect for womens rights
member of the commission this could be a long answer but in short we try to cooperate pool resources and policies in order to promote better conditions for young people
i can however state that our commitment appropriations have been largely used but that there has been clear overbudgeting for payment appropriations
madam president this is on the same issue in relation to the free vote
eu states have signed the un convention against transnational organised crime which commits governments to adopt within their domestic legal systems the measures necessary to enable the confiscation of the proceeds of crime
i do expect it however to open doors to the future and to position the european union on many issues
the flemish and walloon societies are different their political and economic worlds are different and therefore they opt for different approaches and priorities
the deadline by which it had to answer the commission s questions expired on december and we have not received a reply
antiasylum legislation the inhumane record numbers of asylum requests refused and mediaeval living conditions in immigration centres were not enough
the eu should also make a major contribution to this shortfall
mr president my dear madam i would be delighted to discuss this issue because the commission takes the overall view that there is no sense in using large sums of community money to buy new ships and that it would be better to use the money so that poor small fishermen facing serious economic difficulties have more of a chance in the future
conducting research means creating jobs for the future and improving the lifestyle of our children efforts must therefore be made in europe to improve the attainment and dissemination of research findings and to facilitate access to them

we are thus already familiar with safeguard clauses and therefore it is not a case of discrimination against the new members
our european flower will have to coexist with no fewer than eight european systems
in relation to the maritime transport sector i agree with the aim of achieving a level playing field but i also believe it is important to work within the international maritime organisation to designate the new sulphur emission control areas otherwise we shall drive part of the european fleet to register in noneu countries where controls are virtually nonexistent
i do not believe however that we have fully discharged our responsibilities here for the near future
parliament has just decided to opt for expost controls in the end i therefore voted against the final version of this report
in turn this teaches us to show solidarity with people who are different who are less welloff and who above all have a harder time of it than we do
this is the reason why my group is abstaining from voting on this issue on this report in particular although we wish all the best to the ombudsman and more specifically to the citizens who submit their complaints to him
thirdly after the election in the form of a clear unwillingness to hand over power to those elected
we want a statute for european political parties because our democracy is a civil and partypolitical parliamentary democracy

although the market opening is still extremely limited my group can agree with the councils common position
similarly i agree with wto labelling as an instrument for providing information on origin and production methods
the community competences in each of these two areas are too dissimilar from one another
we must be more rigorous in periods of strong growth for example the obligation to have a balanced budget on the basis of growth or more the obligation to use anything that exceeds the growth in order to decrease debt and to leave the states in the euro zone with more flexibility for investment spending during a recession phase
there has been empirical evidence to prove that reducing business taxation reducing the cost of labour increases employment opportunities increases real jobs with real incomes and also can lead to greater social benefits because of increased taxation delivery
if we talk about the need for reconciliation then it is true that justice is to be done first and the criminal court that has been set up for this purpose is therefore an extremely important instrument for ensuring the international rule of law particularly in its preventive effect on people with dubious criminal backgrounds who have acquired high political positions as we have witnessed in yugoslavia and near the great lakes in africa

what actually happened was an incitement to clinically unassisted i repeat unassisted abortion with the aim of exploiting the fact that many pregnant women are needy and illinformed encouraging them to break the law purely for propaganda purposes

we should like to stress once again that genuine streamlining and limiting of the maximum payment per farmer in the common agricultural policy will help not only to redistribute the aid more fairly among the member states farmers and farms but also to increase support to the market for small and medium sized farmers and the amounts available for rural development in particular for compensation payments and support for organic farming

this is why we have not defined a onesizefitsall plan but a coordinated plan based on the instruments already at our disposal in europe the stability and growth pact and the lisbon strategy for growth and jobs but by defining the common aims to be pursued in a coordinated fashion for economic recovery
the commission starts from the principle that it is important in order to evaluate the quality of higher education to base it on european cooperation on transnational exchange of experience and on the positive advice of experts

mr president i wish to thank both my colleagues and mrs wallstrom for the viewpoints that have been put forward in this debate and that i think provide quite a clear picture of the lines of demarcation

we continue to give this matter close attention

they will be dragged before the courts
i also support the idea that we must try hard to ensure that market forces work to halt the development of climate change

a new law is being introduced that will prevail in the european union and this supreme law my dear friends is parkinsons law
his responsibilities as rapporteur on this highly complex issue have not been easy to measure up to
there have to be increased levels of cooperation between the authorities in the eu member states in the prevention of and fight against crime
before the vote on citation
it needs the lisbon strategy
the commissioner has also already provided the honourable member with information in writing on the action taken by the commission to control these threats

the withdrawal of the unhcr from the tripartite agreement means that asylumseekers are exposed to even greater risk of being influenced intimidated and coerced into returning to vietnam
in particular while fair trade distribution and labelling schemes are well developed for food and drink products this is not the case for garments
mr president i wish to begin by saying on behalf of my group that we are very strongly in favour of continuing a form of common fisheries policy within the european union because we understand that the management of resources is the best way forward for securing guarantees for the continuation of social and economic development in a lot of coastal regions of the european union which would have no other benefit and could not get employment or other developments except from their own natural resources for example fishing and aquaculture
i do however have certain doubts as to whether one member state supporting its economy in this way will not reduce stability in the european market
the reason is that in each member state we already have in place a number of public prosecutors with special competence in their own areas to deal with fraud and criminal prosecutions and to understand the rules and requirements of evidence in each of the member states
firstly the region is of extreme strategic importance for the european union in terms of security energy supplies transportation and trade environment etc
having said all that i do think it is very important to remind ourselves of the real issues at stake here
one of the basic principles of the current multiannual financial framework and the next financial perspectives must be the principle of solidarity social and territorial cohesion must be ensured in this way
because if institutional reform does not go far enough it will endanger the very process of building europe

our priorities are smart sustainable and inclusive growth support for research development growth innovation and work and a boost for the development of small and mediumsized enterprises

it is therefore crucial to demand that in future countries are not all treated in the same way
our proposal builds extensively on the existing european patent system which governs the rules and procedures leading to the grant of european patents and this approach requires that the community should adhere to the european patent convention
we are voting for the report because it is necessary to prevent chapter aircraft which generate more pollution and noise from the usa ending up in eu countries when they are no longer permitted in the usa
first of all i would like to thank mr elmar brok who prepared the draft resolution on this important issue
no amendments have been proposed
we are in a situation where we need to see ourselves in relation to worldwide not just internal competition
from this financial crisis the lesson we must learn is for our member states to stop treating as a taboo subject any cooperation in the budgetary fiscal and social fields
after all they are the people who are out there day after day fishing round the shores of the european union
why are we as parliament in this firstpillar document over which parliament therefore has control now willingly and explicitly encouraging the council to conclude agreements about the systematic registration of peoples surfing behaviour and other electronic activities in the third pillar behind closed doors and with minimum parliamentary and judicial control
western sahara is the last example in the world of a process of decolonisation having remained incomplete one where the neighbouring country is enjoying the benefits of illegal occupation of a foreign territory rejecting security council resolutions repeatedly ignoring un demands for a referendum and the right to selfdetermination for the people of western sahara and infringing human rights and standards of international law

if the guerrillas or the autodefensas violate human rights this fact must be reported and they must be punished
the eu is thus capable of making decisions
and to this add making strengthened cooperation more flexible
but i contrast this discussion with the kind which one might have in a national parliament where frankly the issue itself is of such dramatic importance to the establishment of this role that it ought perhaps to be dealt with not in this particular plenary but elsewhere
in addition economic cooperation will be strengthened with the aim of supporting and developing sectors that create jobs
three years after the relaunch in the lisbon strategy for growth and jobs is working
the matter should therefore be very thoroughly analysed so that mistakes will not be made later which will then need to be corrected
mr president not only is croatia culturally and historically anchored in central europe but also it already meets all the accession criteria
in conclusion i am delighted at parliaments work
nonetheless it is essential for the commission to undertake an in depth study of this problem
that then we even have to divide up again between the two rapporteurs because strictly speaking we have only one directive but its two dossiers mean that there are two rapporteurs
supervisory legislation must be amended and precautions for crisis management improved
the subcommittee on human rights heard how there is real concern about the nonimplementation of human rights in laos cambodia and vietnam
these are the two solutions

indeed ladies and gentlemen life is no longer the programme that we once knew but will indeed constitute the unions environment budget heading
as regards euro notes we should not overlook the needs of the visually impaired and older people
we recognise that the international community failed to realise what was happening until it was too late and failed in its duty to protect innocent civilians unarmed men women and children
they must also appear in one document if possible and be sufficiently widely distributed because mr howitt has demonstrated in his report based on consultations held in various regions of the european union that when the guidelines reach the regions themselves they are confused late and at times do not have any effect on the projects under way
consequently we shall give our support to amendments nos and amongst others
thank you very much mr ilgenfritz i have a request to speak on a point of order from a member who has a placard in front of him which the bureau has already asked him to remove

for this they need confidence and confidence only comes through openness and transparency

i can understand that but it should not be at the expense of missions in emerging democracies in asia latin america and especially africa
i want to say now to the council that if it is going to take unilateral action of that sort i hope it will come to this parliament
what we need is a comprehensive system and i believe we are working towards this together i am also convinced that during the course of this year working jointly with the commission we will be successful
we welcome the fact that our proposals for a european loan to finance transeuropean networks which are currently at a standstill in the council have been included
instead they represent a barrier to the internal market
it can be a source of innovation for new and established companies alike and it offers unique approaches to finally solving problems for example in the fields of healthcare and novel pharmaceuticals
firstly that we have a common analysis of the problems that have affected our economies

where it is discovered during an inspection that a member state is paying insufficient attention to the regulations or has undertaken unsatisfactory measures for the execution of the guidelines it has to be decided if a charge of contravention should be initiated against such a member state

i think we need to tackle the problem of governance the stability of institutions and economic development in the region
but i am sorry that the question of reducing working hours has not been properly expressed by the commission
further i believe we all agree that we would like to see in place a prime minister of the palestinian authority who would be willing and able to act against terrorist organisations and put an end to them
mr president i had resigned myself to being overlooked to some extent in the same way as my nonattached colleagues for whom i certainly speak in offering you the congratulations that are due to yourself but rather less it must be said to the method of your election since your triumphant election is in a way the result of an agreement between the two main groups of this house which oppose one another rather artificially at election time and then go on to jointly manage parliament for five years

the issue was brought to a head at the end of with the expiry of a transitional period for fixing mrls for established drugs
madam president mr presidentinoffice of the council commissioner croatia is the first country for whose accession to the european union following experience from the last two enlargements with romania and bulgaria the bar has rightly been set very high which is why the benchmarks and progress made by croatia are especially praiseworthy
for this reason it would be very helpful if the council could present these proposals to the convention on the future of europe in time for them to be discussed and incorporated if that is agreed into the outcome its work which is to be presented to the intergovernmental conference next year
in december in helsinki the council established the timetable for the european council in gothenburg and called upon the council to complete its work on incorporating the environmental dimensions into all the council s activities by producing overall strategies if possible accompanied by a timetable for the measures to be taken and a set of indicators for the sectors concerned

the legal uncertainty that exists concerning eligibility for crossborder healthcare and refunds must be removed and accurate and clear information about when and how medical treatment in other member states is covered must be available to patients
to a certain extent it does

of course the most important aspect for the committee on regional development is financing cohesion policy and we draw attention to the fact that during the natural course of the sevenyear cycle we have reached the phase where the member states draw or try to draw and spend larger and larger amounts based on their conceived programmes
you will have members who wish neither to vote in favour of a text or against a text but who wish to indicate their presence in the chamber by pressing the button of abstention
the decision by the israeli government to push ahead with its plan to build new homes in east jerusalem to extend the settlement on the west bank to maintain the isolation of the gaza strip and to generally step up the attacks by the israeli army in the occupied palestinian territories reveals to even the most ardent disbeliever the criminal plans of israel and of the imperialists in general against the palestinian people and the people in the area as a whole
why can it not used to give us leverage in asia
the operators would in particular benefit fully from the advantage of a centralised transparent and timelimited procedure
i think that we have arrived at a good settlement both as regards the way we appoint the director of the foundation but also as regards the fact that we can appoint three experts without voting rights on the governing board
much is now contained in this report which will be passed during this parliaments final plenary sitting
before asking these member states possibly to reconsider their votes it is necessary that after finland the other dilatory member states express their opinions beginning with the united kingdom poland sweden portugal ireland and denmark
one wonders moreover what interest these future trading partners could have in such agreements since the cost of failure to conclude an agreement would be minimal in relation to the present volume of trade between the two parties
some people believe that nato could become the new world or regional police force and perhaps see a basis for this in the text of natos washington declaration
clearly we are all responsible for finding a way forwards
this absence of comprehensive followup studies is a disgrace and i would ask the commission to commit clearly to measures to carry out a comprehensive international study of this kind
i for my part am not certain that in a classic orthodox view of the separation of powers a parliamentary initiative of this type is valid
firstly the possibility of achieving the aim of the european union namely to create a high degree of security for our citizens in an area of freedom security and justice whilst and this has also been clearly expressed by the various speakers our fundamental rights as set out in the european charter of fundamental rights are fully respected
this kind of indiscriminate use of antibiotics is common in the eu but is even more so in powerful countries that practise industrial agriculture like the usa
anyone who challenges my claim that this is basically aimed at the vested interests of the arms industry only has to look at what we voted on today and what the council decided
mr president mrs gyori commissioner we are all aware that both of these countries romania and bulgaria have invested a great deal in securing the external borders of the european union
we have just adopted an amendment to article of annex v to the rules of procedure which states with regard to both the granting and refusal of discharge that the proposal for a decision on granting discharge may not be the subject of amendments you said that this would take effect immediately
launched in the context of the reflection group in advance of the intergovernmental conference this concept seemed to constitute in the first instance the miracle solution needed to get us out of the stagnation which threatens us
we have enriched the acquis communautaire with the single currency it will serve as a benchmark for the countries which want to join the european union
a few years ago our colleague michel rocard said that france could not accommodate all the poverty of the world
amendment no poses a problem for member states regarding continuing training to the extent that such training has to be funded by the sailors own states and not by the european union
what is even more alarming is that the presidentdesignate of the next commission romano prodi stated yesterday morning in this hemicycle that the next international negotiations should open and i quote a further round of liberalisation
for the period the overall world market in renewable energies will be almost eur billion
therefore we want to defend and keep the wording as voted by the committee
something i regard as a very important aspect of the resolution that will be put to the vote tomorrow and this remark is also addressed to mrs figueiredo who played a leading part in this success is that we have managed to present joint proposals for new indicators with which progress towards achievement of the lisbon objectives can be measured particularly the objective of improving peoples quality of life
i feel it is wrong that there has not been a detailed analysis of the precise environmental impact that dredging up km of the seabed may have
we all know that it will at best be a very big task to bring the commission s ponderous and highhanded bureaucracy up to the standard we require of public administration in our home countries
at the same time i believe that it is a directive that can avoid two extremes and that will be the case if the amendments are approved as some of us hope
so far as the state of preparedness of the ten countries that will be acceding on may is concerned ladies and gentlemen we have kept you informed of the results of our monitoring
both these elements are in line with parliaments discharge recommendations
at the same time new steps must be taken to boost the use of rural development funds by livestock farmers
this is a responsibility we all share and one which comes under our education and social policies
it has emerged that the extent of the task was underestimated by all those concerned
the present proposal also addresses environmental challenges more closely
imagine how out of control our system would have let things get before the european system was implemented at the time of the war in iraq and of september
i would now like to turn to my proposal
in fact we have not had a legislative programme for several years now
europes entrepreneurs expect something different their expectations are for the security that makes it possible to plan for the long term for qualified workers the best possible infrastructure promotion of science and research the weedingout of rules and regulations and investment
in the past this report was always the subject of fierce debates on farm incomes
it will also allow the prevention of a precise profiling of the consumer
in actual fact what we are doing is to encourage them to go even faster and we have no young farmers coming into the industry
europe was such an idea and it still is one
the negotiations have not been terminated but being frank about it i indicated that the prospects were not good
we have to contemplate different alternatives if there is either a referendum or a process that will lead to the independence of montenegro
could she tell us whether she is planning research simply on substances in isolation or whether any work at all is going to be done on the cocktail effect which many people feel is particularly dangerous in this field and about which very little is known
i believe this is essential
this obligation also extends to the feedstuffs used and the state of health of animals
secondly we think it should be possible to spend no less than of official development cooperation on millennium development objectives among which hivaids should occupy centre stage
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen let us be honest and realistic
when we initiated the debate last week at one of the european schools in brussels it was clear that the interests of citizens extend far beyond the examples of institutional issues given in nice
five drawing a distinction between separatism and cultural autonomy can be a key to progress in resolving this problem
clearly the european central bank and its president mr trichet take the banks mandate and the maastricht criteria seriously
i believe the commission listened to us quite carefully on this recent package although not i regret to say on the proposals regarding mutuals and the european statute for associations
after weighing up all the pros and cons of this directive however i am convinced that we will make the right decision tomorrow if we adopt this directive with the amendments proposed by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market and various other clarifications
mr president commissioner in the proposal that is being put to us the european commission is asking parliament and the council to give our opinion on whether the evaluation period for active substances which was to be completed by july should be extended to
central control from brussels is no way to manage the seas and oceans of europe and the wider world
neither the commission paper nor the kindermann report contained proposals for such a ban
i should therefore like to ask the commission to give special attention to this sector
therefore her bridging amendments which commit the available margin of the categories are firstly an imaginative solution to strengthen the role of the european parliament and make the council face up to its own inconsistency and secondly proof that the ceiling of of own resources is ridiculous and does not help deepen community policies
i would hope that it would apply to such issues as the granting of contracts on a fair and open basis rather than giving them to your rich friends
with a third of eu oil being imported from russia and a quarter from the middle east and those proportions are rising we face a structural problem which goes far beyond any shortterm crisis
in the budget we have no additional funds available for use as direct aid to farmers for example
this is a task that we cannot put off to the crack of doom and i would like by way of conclusion to repeat what commissioner ferrerowaldner has already said namely that the council needs this agreement in order to put the final finishing touches to the other three instruments
in this respect let me inform you that opec has committed to help to stabilise the international oil market and to contribute to bringing oil prices back to sustainable levels
the lesson to be learned from this situation is that in order to support democracy in africa the african union needs an action plan which would prevent coups that result in enormous losses for the citizens of this poor region of the world
we therefore need to be careful how to manage this because if we reward this one particular year prematurely we will end up in a situation where the possible recovery of this stock will be lost
i think it is incumbent on all of us to ensure that we deliver the strongest possible message that the democratic will expressed by the people of kosovo is respected that it is brought to a conclusion and that the european union has a unified voice on how things should progress in the future
ladies and gentlemen allow me as i do every friday in strasbourg to express today in particular our thanks to all those who work with us allow me to mention each of them
the commission can agree to amendment accepting that eartags may be made of metal or plastic and may consist of one or two parts taking into account approval by the competent authority
in addition it will provide legal certainty which is crucial to entrepreneurs
these will necessarily involve all participants the european union national governments regional and local authorities and operators within the social economy
mr president the situation in kosovo has two features there is no contact between the albanian population and the authorities and both parties are so to speak caught up in their own rhetoric and in the balkans in particular you cannot risk loss of face by negotiating with anyone
the complex issue and this has been a very controversial point of awarding design and execution contracts jointly appreciated and appreciable for some specific categories of contracts cannot be a hard and fast rule
all too often it is the poorest people that face discrimination and inequality in access to health care
i cannot overstate the importance of that particularly because we want those computer scientists to develop the tools products services and new ideas that will help their communities whether it is in health education or other forms of local service provision particularly over a very widespread area and one where communications are very light
the eit should also be a focus of excellence based on a model of integrating the research institutions with companies which we hope will serve as a catalyst for a culture of innovation which is so essential for improving our competitiveness
yesterday the presidency appointed a special emissary who left for tirana today
presidentinoffice of the council madam president i have taken due note of this mornings debate and i am pleased to confirm that many of the concerns voiced by parliament are shared by the council
in my amendments which have been incorporated into the report i have therefore emphasised the need for establishing transparent mechanisms for private investors
commissioner patten cannot be at our sitting today or tomorrow but he will appear before the committee on foreign affairs human rights common security and defence policy next monday
instead of this they confine themselves to primitive coastal fishing and sell their fishing rights to others
that is the only way that a genuine partnership can be established
this is very high on the agenda of the council including that of the jha council and the european council comprising the heads of state and government
we cannot be indifferent and apathetic to these announcements
secondly the current situation affects us all
to demand membership of the who for taiwan is to recognise it as a nation state to grant it an independence that its own government has not even requested
this negative priority is perfectly in keeping with the spirit of the draft resolution
the council must give a strong indication that it will not let itself be overawed by the attempts to destabilise the euro made by certain speculators who have no hesitation in speculating against those member states that are currently facing economic and social difficulties
colleagues i am pleased to inform you that members of a delegation of mps and other visitors from the state great hural of mongolia and the mission of mongolia to the european union have now taken their seats in the distinguished vistors gallery
nonetheless i have already received a very serious complaint from the womens organisations in malta which inform us that the leaders of the political parties are already compiling their lists without including a single woman
in examining the way opinion has been formed i have noticed that the further away from kaliningrad a current member state is the more unrealistic the points it has put forward to solve the problem
this initiative will certainly contribute to further cooperation between the old and the new as well as possible future member states
in other words we do not need disputes about external energy policy and certainly not if that is all we are going to do but rather we need intelligentlyprovided affordable energy for everyone
we have a situation here in which the industry stands on one side the consumers whose rights we are strengthening stand on the other with the dealers sandwiched in between
parliament has attempted to deal with the issue on more than one occasion but it has never appeared to find satisfactory solutions
but here i wish to point out the danger entailed in points and as has already been highlighted by the rapporteur for which the committee on agriculture and rural development has asked for a separate vote
the answer to the honourable member s question is therefore that the council has already started implementing the action plan
this makes it difficult to set up a single european energy market with a free flow of services in this area as well as at an international level
on the other hand we can treat and then reuse important nutrient carriers that were properly prepared for their original use
i voted against this text the european right has given in to the demands of certain governments and to the pressure of the cultural industries at the expense of the fundamental rights of european citizens
we should not allow this to happen and that is why i think that legitimacy is good
this means that genetically modified material unintentionally and unavoidably occurs in imported products particularly bulk shipments of grain for food feed and processing
in this context it is very difficult to establish satisfactory and precise priorities for parliament
i think it gave a good indication of the strength of feeling in the house and perhaps an indication also that you can count on many members here to vote for quite radical reform
i should also highlight the fact that there has been an excellent climate of cooperation and agreement amongst all the political groups represented in the committee on the environment public health and consumer protection
i consider that all of the networks activity should be more useful so that the bodies involved in the decisionmaking process can make practical use of its work
i am against this because things are never clearly black and white but rather various shades of grey
the member states can no longer act as though these two areas are restricted and untouchable competences beyond the scope of common action
i take no pleasure whatsoever in searching for a solution outside our budgets our countries should be quite serious about doing what they say they are going to do but given that they are incapable of keeping their promises this new idea at least has the virtue of not bothering anyone and of being unrestricted if in each of the member states it is the legislative authority that allocates this share of the profit to the world food programme instead of to the local state authorities
an informant in tirana has alerted me to the danger that this spring a large number of albanian girls and women are going to travel to western europe and end up in prostitution rings
we in the liberal group are very conscious that consumers must be able to use the internal market and to compare prices
i do not think that it is an act of discrimination that claims in france should be submitted in french this is a matter of french national law and it seems to me totally logical that compensation claims
it is how we transformed our societies from years ago when life expectancy was very short when there was enormous poverty and when very few people went to school
companies with the lowest labour and environmental costs will then be able to steal the market from their competitors wealthy countries will become richer at the expense of the poorest and the number of those excluded will grow at national level and world level
mr president could you please find out how it could possibly happen that the representative of the dutch presidencyinoffice of the council in zimbabwe in reply to a question by the local ngo and government representatives stated the european parliaments position on cites
countries that are members of the european union as they should be but are not members of the monetary union as they should not be are forced to keep a fixed exchange rate with the euro and thus with their most important trading partners
in this context i agree that some of the recent actions of the chinese authorities are worrying such as the adoption of the antisecession law in relation to taiwan
we need to ensure that this earthquake does not interrupt that progress towards economic and social development
the first was that to which mr poettering referred this morning which is to say that there is no mention of the name of michelin in the resolution on the relocation of companies
mr commissioner i would like to know if you are intending to propose a ban on animal bone meal and within what framework you think this measure might be possible

what do you think about a reduction on the direct income supplements
as regards the banana duties discussed under the free trade agreements to be concluded by the commission with columbia peru and central america i would like to stress that the council has not yet formed an opinion on these agreements and i therefore cannot relay its official position to you at this point
special attention must be given to plastic
i voted against this report because as is often the case with other reports in this owninitiative report europe again advances its own concept of socalled reproductive and sexual rights which it forces on people in developing countries
we must examine whether we thus want to and are able to continue these activities
despite these restrictions we are able to pass a sound verdict now in my opinion
the commission in preparing the proposal was inspired by the findings of the contract framework of reference for example on the black list of unfair contract terms the passingoff and delivery rules as well as the streamlining of the precontractual information requirements
examining what has come out of the conciliation procedure we have to say that the balance is not favourable
and how will we get there
from time to time as far as fisheries are concerned the news we receive is generally bad news
we should point out to the acceding countries that they need to improve this situation
we cannot simply accept assurances from friendly governments concerning the prohibition on torture and cruel and degrading treatment we have a responsibility to ensure that we and our allies act within international law
i am very glad to see that this is a shared opinion and goal not only in this house but also in the three institutions and that is a guarantee of success
we must not lose hope and with that in mind i would like to say a big thank you to both rapporteurs and to the commissioner whose combined efforts have already been mentioned today and for which they have rightly been commended
dha is naturally found in breast milk and it helps the development of childrens eyes
as i said they are the result of a long process not a single meeting
and finally philip i will miss you a bit like a toothache
perhaps the mere announcement of safety nets and alternatives of this kind and the fact that we are discussing them will help all the parties involved to become aware of their responsibilities and with next years referendums in sight will help to make it clear that we in the european institutions are willing and able to announce at the right time that we have succeeded in reaching agreement on the financial perspective
however the text of the resolution and the debate on it have again confirmed my belief that public funds should be used to secure basic public services other activities including research and entrepreneurial activities should be financed from private sources
we know you will give our best wishes to charlie mccreevy from everybody
mr president ladies and gentlemen commissioner it is in european terms intolerable that varosha should be in the state it is a ghost town a town sealed off by barbed wire yet having formerly been home to some people it has been empty for years

we are united in the thought that the interests of those damaged by a cartel must be effectively upheld and that we must subject the european economy to cartel control in accordance with the principle of the social market economy

further to the votes in the committee meetings there are now sound reports before us

during the years of setting up the project we actually had no money whatsoever to support the national initiatives in the countries most affected
there must be no repetitions of this kind of operation in the future
utility models in the single market
the commission appreciates the efforts made by parliament and the rapporteur and the committee on budgets in particular and the efforts made by the finnish presidency of the council
it is a scandal that the italian presidency of the council is not putting the markov report on its agenda
furthermore this success follows the pressure exerted by amongst others this parliament which supported the commissions open skies strategy from the outset and encouraged it in the face of increasing difficulties as in the case of these complicated transatlantic relations

we need to consider whether in some cases the rules and procedures set out in the current lome convention relating to contracts the allocation and management of financial resources and respect for commercial rules of origin may not be the subject of mismanagement and even corruption in some acp countries

from this point of view ukraine is much further advanced than the others and i assume that it is not very happy to see that our offer now has to be shared with the others
too often we forget our experience of previous enlargements involving poorer countries which have of course produced good results
this is confirmed by the type of message and values or to put it another way lack of values that are disseminated through systems for the production and broadcasting of televisions message which are squeezing our own production and suffocating the free expression of independent producers
we must all be given a guarantee that europeans tax payments do not trickle away into the accounts of so many political and economic criminals
since they deal with similar subjects questions nos and will be taken together
what is happening with the enlargement of the european union

everybody in the house must of course ask themselves whether they have prostrated themselves before the pesticide industry or whether they are creating added value for citizens health and the environment

after the election obviously mr fujimori s government could argue that since their candidate fujimori had obtained more than it had to be concluded that even in the absence of any opposition the vote was valid

in this respect i think it is essential to ensure in every member state a policy of education within families and schools which imparts to our young people a sensible knowledge of how one copes with the media both new and old
it would have been quite unreasonable if we had made such a decision
the objective should be to adopt this small and partial reform now that four years have elapsed so that we can concentrate on the need for bigger changes

in addition europeans are also people who form part of a very defined community of law and a community of values which comprises among others gender equality
at the same time we must not lose sight of the longterm challenges
more seriously the speeches by mrs beres mr karas and mrs kauppi in particular show that what we need as has already been said is to make sure that we effectively adopt the commissions proposals which are on the table and which cover all aspects of the supervision regulation and modification of accounting rules

the first reason is specific
on international womens day there is one thing we europeans must all acknowledge in our continent we still have not achieved equal rights but the dramatic injustice towards women in other parts of the world ranging from genital mutilation to the compulsory wearing of the veil all these basic fundamental rights that women and above all girls worldwide are deprived of should not only concern us on march

the first is the plans which we have and which have already been processed by the council the european commission and parliament in connection with avian influenza

madam commissioner you are well known as someone who is always fighting to reduce production costs in agriculture

the continued spending of money in that way is unacceptable
if that is what we are being asked to think it really is unbelievable
the next item is the commission statement on natural disasters
so much spam email is sent
i welcome the possibility that governments that have just come to power might have the right to update their budgetary framework in the medium term to reflect new political priorities
it may also lead to what are known as complications and even to certain kinds of permanent impairment of the body
however given that it meets the european parliaments request for a comprehensive approach to create a true internal market in services i trust that members will give it due consideration and start to discuss it in order to provide a sound basis for the new parliaments work and show the way to the council of ministers

mr president some hours ago i would have said that in spite of the tasteless distortion of cultural emblems and despite articles of ambiguous objectivity referring to outdated stereotypes although the council failed to apprehend the greek economic crisis as a major european issue and the commission failed to use it as a crash test for european cohesion the greek people were ready to support their new socialist government in their struggle for economic and social recovery
this is also true in the case of active ingredients on which there was a resolution last year tabled by mrs sartori and myself which i see has been taken up by the commission
first of all it is farcical that any parliament would want to adopt a report based on a treaty the fate of which is still completely uncertain

it bodes very well for the future that this enlargement is being launched with such strong such unanimous such fine democratic intention
now more than ever the european parliament cannot allow any mistakes to be made on the road to democracy
because that is in fact the essential characteristic of the present budgetary process and furthermore it conflicts with the priority which it is claimed is being given to employment
it is simply a question of whether we wish to go on building with faith in our own strength and with the courage of our convictions

however commissioner i do not believe that the council has achieved the maximum possible in this field
some methods of health prevention and early detection of illness are essential
i also agree with those who said that although it was perhaps a coincidence president klaus chose a very good week to sign the treaty the same week that we are celebrating the fall of the berlin wall the end of the communist dictatorship the start of european unity and finally the victory of robert schumans ideas over those of joseph stalin

even though we had wished to see stronger provisions on social clauses we have voted in favour of the report as a whole because we welcome the review and the broad thrust of the report

the recent period has been characterised above all by the challenge which globalisation has presented to european industrial policy and real production in europe

the establishment of the european external action service should contribute further to the development of a truly comprehensive european approach to civilian and military crisis management conflict prevention and peacebuilding and provide the eu with adequate structures staffing levels and financial resources to meet its global responsibilities

in writing i voted for this resolution which considers that the problem of undeclared work needs to be tackled states that the domestic work sector is characterised by a high level of informality and undeclared work that many migrant workers are employed in this sector and that their rights are often violated further considers it essential to combat precarious work in general given that this problem affects migrant workers in particular thus worsening their already vulnerable position
in fact i believe it is of prime importance to create a simpler and more flexible legislative framework that enhances freedom and decisionmaking power in the implementation phase of laws compared with previous measures that were too detailed
all of these things are causing us deep concern and we have seen little if any action on all of these important issues
it must be a mandate for a constitutional treaty a document that will create the basis for this enlarged union
as in the majority of west african countries of course there is tension between the christian and animistic south and the predominantly muslim north as well as problems relating to borders which were drawn by the colonial powers in a highly arbitrary manner and which generally separate ethnic groups and sometimes even entire nations living on either side of them
nevertheless the report discusses developments in bank charges and commissions in the euro zone a full assessment is needed to investigate the introduction of excessive increases especially for domestic payments and illegal charges on crossborder payments

if i may speak on behalf of the uk once again we particularly welcome this because we have been among the most active users of the fiscalis programme over the last few years
with regard to patents not only are we completely against any idea of patenting living beings but we are against the equally horrendous patents on medical products which cannot be used for the care of millions of human beings too poor to pay
this is quite definitely an important and core issue
thirdly it is also important for us to set a date for starting further negotiations
however if we transfer more responsibilities to the eu expecting it to finance ambitious projects while at the same time cutting funding then we will be guilty of acting against solidarity within the european union because we will encourage internal divisions in the fight for funds for example in cohesion policy
the governments demanded the euro for ideological reasons whereas large financial organisations demanded it for reasons that are purely selfmotivated the euro has been around for two years and it has failed to catch on even amongst its most ardent supporters and still less so within the international markets

the first decision is about setting up the system of special forensic profiling analysis
some of frances partners such as germany suggest that responsibility for these monetary agreements be transferred to european level

therefore the minimum limit for immediate available funds was eliminated in favour of a minimum threshold for capital and reserves

this is a welcome and highly important measure for young people as such it must enter into force at the earliest opportunity

one could point to the french german or italian performance by way of an example for in fact not a hair on anyones head was harmed as a result nor did even a single euro have to be paid by way of a deposit
what is the councils reply
in romania the annual expenditure on pensions is the largest category of budgetary expenditure
mrs kaufmann and mrs buitenweg were of the opinion that a deal had been done behind the backs of the smaller groups but i would like to remind them that the european united left and the greens had already rejected the committees compromise and it is hardly productive to initiate negotiations with groups that are categorically opposed to a proposal after all they as a matter of principle will negotiate on all other matters with any group other than the group of the european peoples party
citizens of europe are afraid of the nontransparent use of gmos and oversight by parliament means openness and transparency
reading the report of the temporary committee of inquiry into bovine spongiform encephalopathy there is no doubt that the commission deserves to be censure for its downright failure to fulfil its responsibilities in terms of prevention and protection of public health
i also welcome point of the proposal which concerns stricter regulations governing advertising
there is no doubt that the agreement we now have provides great opportunities to solve those problems which exist and to prevent new problems from arising
mr president the message for mrs schreyer this evening is crystal clear she should say to mr prodi that we have no need of his action plans
it was a harsh lesson
the establishment of closer dialogue in the area of energy policy should therefore constitute a priority and at the same time it will have to be shown in practice to be mutually beneficial
only a frank and open debate on this constitutions flaws and dangers will make it possible for the peoples of europe and the citizens of the eu to see it as something more than a basic law handed down from on high

it is unfortunate that we must speak about this in the absence of one of our great contemporaries mr cohnbendit who initiated this resolution together with others such as mrs andreleonard

it is also the case that europes very security is at stake
i have listened to the users carefully and i have consulted widely
in writing i and my irish epped colleagues abstained on the report on the amendments to the kohlicek report
mr robles piquer knows that in this assembly itself we have had an example fairly recently of a leader of a political group in this assembly and not so long ago someone who became chairman of the group of the european peoples party being involved in an exercise of abusing our voting system a system which is sometimes i am told called playing the piano in the european parliament where we have people pressing more than one button and pressing the buttons of absent friends

then the heads of the state and government of the european union will discuss this question at quarterly intervals ie in october and in december which will produce the necessary pressure for tackling matters politically at the level of talks between the foreign ministers and the representatives instead of merely becoming absorbed in technical details
so it is also necessary to establish very quickly whether the international presence in bosnia so fundamental to any reconstruction effort is to continue
the commission is also concerned about the system of sanctions imposed by the united states on those countries that refuse to sign those agreements and we are continuing to express our concern about these issues in our dialogue with the united states

certainly however a very important issue on which russia can demonstrate its cooperation with us is in cooperating and reaching an agreement on the area of climate change

however it is clear that european community financing does not meet the requirements and challenges to complete transeuropean transport networks despite the beneficial effect that such investments have in developing local and national economies
i would therefore call for periodic reports from the council and the commission to this parliament so that we can keep a finger on the pulse and can highlight in good time the need to intensify that policy
i trust that the environment will be dealt with adequately by the greens and others
i am also convinced that we must fully exploit these systems and applications in due course
we must continue to discuss it but to do so with great care and to include the member states and their legal options in the discussion so that ultimately we achieve what it is we all want and that is a real european model that is particularly attractive to consumers and that also protects small and mediumsized enterprises

from what i hear the commission has got it more or less right and i would like to put a couple of questions for the sake of clarity
we have to work together with everyone including russia but i see the european union as having a special responsibility to make it clear that this european people too will have a place among us but that the osce and then the council of europe must do their work and above all and most crucially human rights must be made to prevail
so let us focus on certain important issues so as to set the process in motion

mr president commissioner it is good that we at least agree on jointly prosecuting four common offences but what is important in reality is that these traffic offences really are punished not just that we say we agree that numerous offences should be prosecuted

in this context i must however note the difference between theory and practice because sadly the cooperation council has not met once since ie over the duration of the trade and cooperation agreement that is now being superseded because it was blocked

in my view these acts are not due to bureaucracy or negligence often they are due to mistaken or the wrong policy adopted by the institutions of the european union
primarily i should like to know which instruments and economic means the union will use to insist upon safeguarding individual languages so that the measure that we are about to approve is not simply a vague resolution but has positive results in the regions concerned
the first is that you cannot directly equate the concept of innovation with research and technological development since innovation must be regarded first and foremost as a function of the interplay between the technological supply and demand
the markets believe it as can be seen from the fact that the liquidity crises elsewhere in the world have had no impact whatsoever on the internal exchange rate relationships in europe
such powers mean greater transparency in the relations between the european institutions and the citizens companies associations and other bodies with a registered office in the eu

we must make intelligent transport systems possible apply the potential offered by the internet to the management of freight transport by standardising weights dimensions and rules governing freight reducing redtape and establishing onestop access points
this was very important
to develop and harmonise public health at the highest level ought to be one of the tasks of the european union if its raison d etre is not merely to concern itself chiefly with the movement of capital and goods

fourthly without easing up on the strictness of application by any means and i must emphasize this mr president the amendments allow a certain flexibility which is necessary if the stability pact is to function properly and if it is to be both applicable and reliable
but these objections do not mean that we do not wish the commission well in its task
the increase is intended mostly for areas such as structural funds science research and education
mr president sometimes colleagues in this parliament make life very difficult for its friends
naturally my group supports these two reports wholeheartedly
the agreement which should be supported anticipates that eu vessels of which there will be in the geographical area will take at least of their crew members from sao tome and principe or from other acp countries and also provides the opportunity for an observer designated by the fisheries ministry of sao tome and principe to be on board
this after all is what the white paper on integrated product policy is about or in any case that is what almost everybody on the committee on industry external trade research and energy thought
the presidency cannot do otherwise it has to adhere to the principles decided by the council
the charter on the freedom of the press initiated by the european journalist community is an important reaffirmation of the basic values enshrined in fundamental legal texts such as the eu charter of fundamental rights
obviously if no agreement is reached at second reading there is the possibility of conciliation but we should try to resolve the problems beforehand
it must also encompass the foreign policies of the member states
the member states use what in the private sphere are resources not shown on the balance sheet in other words guarantees
president of the commission not only have we revised the rules of the globalisation fund we have also reprogrammed the european social fund with the fasttracking of eur billion to reinforce active labour market policies
firstly as mr fourcans and others have indicated there is a need to continue with strict budgetary policies
question no by nuala ahern
it is clear that these attacks are largely pretexts
the commission has nevertheless deemed it useful to separate the two proposals in order to give the proposal a chance of success
i should like first to comment on the broad economic policy guidelines
estonia was among the first countries to go into recession
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on wednesday september
with mr gray as chief accountant and mr oostens as director of the accountancy division we shall have two qualified and experienced accountants and qualified managers at the head of this ambitious project which if it is successful and i am confident that it will be will put the eu administration at the forefront of modern public administration in accountancy as it is in other areas
mr president i would like to mention three points
madam president mrs lulling asked us to support the motion for a resolution
in writing statistical data form an important basis for political decisions
the drop will perhaps not be as much as the points i mentioned earlier
european citizens main concern is still about keeping their jobs and ensuring a decent living
the proposed changes relate to firstly the optimum exploitation of fish stocks secondly the correct method for fisheries management and appropriate fishing methods and finally and thirdly preventing illegal fishing
vicepresidenthigh representative ashton you have very clearly heard this morning that parliament will fully support your leadership role and is demanding that you take the initiative in our common foreign and security policy
this coordinated cooperation between the member states the european union and the private sector which is using a new coordinated approach for a longterm community strategy in the fight against these three diseases has the considerable merit of actively involving the developing countries themselves enabling real improvements to be made
examples of this can certainly be seen within the textile sector
the committee on institutional affairs has therefore decided to focus on the elements that appear to give the necessary impetus to the unions development
human rights and those who defend them are opposed because their activity leads to increased social awareness and citizens who know their rights are an enormous threat to the abuses of the authorities
it does not matter what the something is gbp billion in britain eur billion in europe usd billion in the us alright that is something let us do it
this is not only for the benefit of the environment in which regard it helps to implement the kyoto targets on reducing emissions but it also reduces noise pollution especially for those people who live or work along the transit routes
in conclusion i can assure you that these issues can and will be urgently and seriously addressed
it seems to me that something of a credibility gap is developing here one that may cause a great deal of damage in days to come
we can now also see how very dangerous it is
here for the first time we have an opportunity to develop the union on three institutions the traditional european community the economic and monetary union and the political union freely that is without extreme pressure from outside as was the case during the cold war with its threat of nuclear strikes
this is something that has been called for by producers and i think that it should be supported especially given that the fund is financed solely by the sector and therefore has no financial impact on the community budget
until the end of this mandate and beyond i wish you much success in your work plenty of new ideas and steady persistence in the development of european values democracy and way of life
this wish expressed by the committee on culture youth education and the media and written by our parliament into its resolution regarding the igc appears not to have been honoured today by negotiators from the member states
madam president this parliament must respect slovakias right as a sovereign country to determine its own energy policy and to operate a nuclear plant if it so wishes
this was not a case of political manoeuvring
this experience tells us clearly that where money was spent on hard infrastructure investments and in accordance primarily with the gdp criterion the expenditure brought advantages to the entire european union both to member states which are net contributors to european funds and to those which are net beneficiaries
on some essential points it deviates from the text that we as the socialist group in the european parliament originally contributed
bilateral agreements like those between the european union and the usa are helpful certainly but they do not solve the problem because the problem is concerned not only with information but also with strategic lines of action
we are now talking about significant changes in the law long lists of further regulations of substances which may be banned
i am quoting animal welfare in this connection
in this regard i take note of the strong message from you on the need for significant improvements to simplify the prospectus
as the european parliaments powers in this matter have increased since the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon i hope that the council does not revert to unequal direct payments for farmers of the old and new member states and will not approve any additional general funding which might damage fair competition in the single eu market
with regard to cooperation the community has showed its willingness to contribute to a lasting development in laos and an improvement in the living conditions of the people of laos
it also seems appropriate to retain the present strategy of purchasing the buildings we use
therefore it is an aspect of the internal market and one that is very close to the citizen
failure on a grand strategic scale
we agree that the reference period for offshore work may be extended to months
we are bound to call on the ukrainian authorities to cancel the second round of the presidential elections and to organise a rerun of the second round but not new elections that would eliminate current candidates
let me clarify that
the reason for this question is in fact to ask the commission not just to express its position on parliament s proposals clearly but above all to ask it for the procedures and time periods for the tabling of its own revised version on parliament s position
irrespective of their political complexion presentday eu governments have however made the adaptation to emu their priority rather than welfare and the fight against unemployment
this was especially true i think of the last igc on the occasion of which in its resolutions of november and february parliament had expressed the desire to discuss global reform of the institutions in the same spirit as the commission
the second is that variation in the level of airport charges will continue to be possible and i also have in mind for instance variation based on environmental performance based on noise nuisance this would make a steering policy possible
this truly is a good report and i would like to express my warmest thanks to mr deva and the development committee for the work they have done
therefore it seems to me that the council s proposal to the united nations however important and positive the initiative may be is very timid because calls on those states which retain the death penalty and i quote to progressively restrict the number of crimes for which it is imposed
i would also like to say that i personally have always thought that the legal basis for this amendment lay strictly speaking in the treaty
we are only being forced to introduce such drastic measures thanks to the total failure of the cfp
we cannot resolve additional problems without additional resources
the basic point i would like to make about the report is that you cannot have more europe for less money and so it is to say the least desirable that we should come to a speedy and realistic agreement on the financial perspective
our second point of criticism is that the call for the member states to gradually improve their military capabilities is incompatible with the aims of the left as is the entrenchment of a european armaments agency in primary european law
we have to proceed with caution and with flexibility
in this period of the worsening crisis of capitalism the majority of this house is once again sending the message that the end justifies the means in this case the end is to try to contain chinas extraordinary economic development including by fostering separatism within its borders

the work done by portugal as the country holding the presidency has not been easy
so the national parliaments find themselves sidelined and replaced by a body of officials who will proclaim the charter
we must also maintain unrelenting concentration on afghanistan on which we had a donors meeting here in brussels at the beginning of the week a recognition of how prominent a part we are playing under un auspices in the reconstruction in that country which still faces appalling problems

strengthening relations with the republic of moldova is also included among the common foreign policy priorities in view of signing the association agreement with the eu
my group will therefore be voting for his report but we are still debating paragraph of amendment where we do have a fear that in essence it contradicts the previous paragraphs in the report and where it opens the door to parliament becoming involved in the substance of a case rather than in whether or not there should be a waiver of immunity
in my own country as in many others the outstanding work done by mr vieira de mello on behalf of the un especially in timor leste was widely known and enormously regarded
we shall of course look into the matter thoroughly
finally i would ask the commissioner or the council why the social security directive has not to date been reviewed
the report we are debating today is about the implementation of article of the treaty of amsterdam concerning employment policy incentives
these might include in particular
although it is true to say that the committee on agriculture and rural development has not managed to produce clear reports on the reforms of the common organisations of the market we must take account of the fact that the commissions proposals have been rejected by a wide majority
then all our proposed amendments would have been adopted in the codecision procedure
the united states is not moving very quickly to implement these decisions
it is in breach of laws that have been used and continue to be used to try and pass sentence on the most odious criminals including the nazis
why may we do so
this has led to resources being wasted and additional problems being created for the countries concerned
i shall now continue where i left off by emphasising that these future prospects depend on systematic pursuit of the reform efforts and on the implementation of decisions
the resolution calls for a referendum under un auspices on allowing east timor the right to selfdetermination

of course this weighs particularly heavily on the infrequent user often elderly housebound who cuts down on telephone calls
on the humanitarian side in addition to the support package already adopted it is proposed that eur million from the commissions jakarta pledge be allocated from the emergency reserve
although the commission communication speaks about the possibility of attracting cofinancing from the th european development fund it is not all clear how decisions will be made on allocating the budget between the acp countries on the one hand and the more developed and advanced noneu eastern european countries supported by cofinancing from the european bank for reconstruction and development
moreover we will also need to analyse a range of energy investments already initiated on both sides
so it is gratifying that at the council of europe a charter awaiting signature which forbids the cloning of humans
what for example is the meaning of article where according to one of the conditions peoples presence is assumed to constitute a threat to public order
the belarusian authorities need to understand that if they fail to respect human rights and the rule of law in compliance with the joint declaration made at the eastern partnership summit on may of which the belarusian government is also a cosignatory the european union will not be able to offer any commitment of support

corruption is widespread
that is why the commission is taking very strict measures to contain the disease and as i said the best way to fight it is a vaccination

i am convinced that the european union has to take all these factors into consideration in the future
the commission welcomes parliaments support in the process since the motion for a resolution broadly supports the initiatives we have taken hitherto
as far as the economy is concerned however and the fulfilment of certain criteria while counting on the evolution of the various applicant countries in the future in accordance with the findings of our own analyses we have come to the conclusion that it is already possible although none of the applicant countries fulfils the economic criteria at present to open negotiations with some of them

yesterday we discussed the middle east situation in this house where there is a strong commitment to resolving the conflict
it is essential for this house to link the return fund with a return directive but it has not succeeded in doing so

i find it unacceptable that one of the officials of the european commission in the committee on fisheries should have dared to state in public that the financial resources awarded by the commission to some scientific bodies should give it the right to have control over their conclusions

the croatian economy is already very strongly intermeshed with the economy of the european union and is clearly outperforming the economies of bulgaria and romania for example whose accession is envisaged for
if we impose further restrictions on european industries we will jeopardise both the competitiveness of companies and employment and in the end investments will shift towards countries that do not raise climaterelated obstacles

there will certainly have to be more liberalisation if constructive changes are to come about
i certainly do not underestimate the hard work and as mr capoulas santos mentioned himself the number of amendments certainly did not make the task any easier in trying to find the middle ground for the landing zone
mr president ladies and gentlemen i only wish to clarify certain issues without getting into a great historical debate since i do not believe that this is the moment to do so nor is it the moment for us to all to start discussing problems that are not germane
you will soon receive a number of proposals from parliament on how the directive might be improved
to conclude i believe we really are a long way off success in the fight against global warming
i absolutely fail to grasp how in view of this economic state of affairs members of this house can manage to come up with two recommendations for us one being that we should deal with the crisis by leaving more muck in the air which is what mr langens proposal in part amounts to the other that we carry on stubbornly wrecking the economy with austerity measures rather than giving it the kickstart that it needs
our main concern is the organisation of free and democratic elections
this is why i believe that it is time to turn a new leaf to change existing policy

sustained economic growth and economic stability are the keys to regional peace and consolidation of that peace in the years ahead

since the beginning of this legislature some have been critical of the fact that of the community budget is allocated to one socioprofessional category representing less than of the european population

i believe that the european dimension of this task is more important than the individual interests of the member states this is why it is essential for us to adopt european rules as without such rules for this field we will be unable to create an internal market
but paper is patient
in the decisions taken at the lisbon council those tools took the form of a social market economy which was a good thing
i could imagine that the structural funds might also be drawn on for exchange programmes in terms of employment policy so as to give a fair chance to a maximum number of school pupils trainees and students who cannot rely on parental aid for educational visits abroad
these explanations of vote are for one minute only
one of the most important is undoubtedly a reduction in the sulphur content of vehicle fuels
military activities therefore represent a small part of aerospace activities in europe and are destined to shrink even more due to the growth in civil demand
i find it interesting that these objections come from a committee which is not very often faced with legislation unlike my committee but when it is does exactly what you reproach me with namely takes it further
however in spite of the european parliaments insistence the commission still appears to be continuing to entrust the taos with the preparation of invitations to tender and the lists of projects to be retained
if they are real terrorists then let them face justice and not languish in a detention camp that the americans do not even dare to put within their own country
another positive step is if it could also be pointed out that there can be a time when confidence will be restored
we should not be dogmatic in this respect
it is after all one of my own country s most distinguished universities
the debate on the garot report will resume at pm
may i also draw your attention to amendment of this report for which some members have requested a separate vote
the report is parliaments message to the luxembourg summit on how to proceed in this historical enlargement process
the rapporteur has actually said himself what this report is about it is about the european parliament further intensifying its role as a kind of representative of eurocratic onedimensional thinking and doing away with the modicum of freedom enjoyed by the smaller political groups
there is a long and sound tradition in denmark of voluntary work among people of all age groups not just young people although the level of activity is significantly higher in this section of the population

the directive should prevent confusion and should not allow any room for grey areas
while the international community works to prevent drug abuse afghanistans illegal opium production discourages individual governments in the surrounding area from contributing financially to the reconstruction of the country
with regard to longterm nonthermal effects however it is considered on the basis of opinions from certain international bodies that there is insufficient evidence to lay down limits for such exposure
consequently we need to focus the tenth edf on a limited number of sectors
i think that the primary reason for the objections is to verify the compatibility between the selections that you have made in putting together the team which you introduced to us today and the general themes which you have presented to this parliament
after all the eu member states are either full members of nato or sit around the euro atlantic partnership council table
madam president commissioner i too would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for her constructive and good cooperation
a strategic eu energy review which would allow us to revisit these issues continually is necessary to provide the best approach in terms of each states energy mix

we declare our support for a clearcut decision on the status issue but we also affirm that europe and particularly this house must support both parties so that both kosovo and serbia can look forward to a bright future
shame on those governments that criticised poland for arguing their interests plus the general interest in an understandable system
we consistently demand of the council and the commission openness and transparency in political decisions
it makes sense for ireland to be treated as one whether in employment agriculture or human rights
but all i can say is that the same thing always happens we always have to put on the pressure first and adopt our own legislation before any global regulations are passed which is why we must push ahead here
we must not forget that europe has a responsibility to provide essential support to the poorest countries of the developing world through a longterm undertaking to help these countries and support them during a process of farreaching change and economic and social development in addition to cancelling the debt
some of you including mr monti have said that this legislation is being reviewed in any case after all a green paper is due by january
these are the ones who were previously responsible for triggering the financial crisis and the debt crisis in the member states
technology platforms and joint technology initiatives are vital mechanisms for achieving this objective
for this reason i cannot accept these amendments either

resettlement schemes are already ongoing in at least five member states
it is the humane face of europe
alongside other issues in particular the social and economic agenda these themes especially enlargement and the future of the union are a priority concern today particularly given that they are running on parallel timetables
passport checks are a thing of the past within the schengen area and there is no longer any need for expensive timeconsuming currency changing
whether we are talking about the amount of the deposit the number of signatures required the checks on this look at what happened in st petersburg a few months ago on not one of these points do they meet the criteria that we and the rest of the world would consider constitute free and fair elections
politically it is highly significant that the european elections should be at the centre of the institutional activities related to enlargement
otherwise it is too contradictory we cannot want to relaunch the mediterranean strategy and then block agreements with individual mediterranean countries
it is not like that however finland has a lot more to offer europe and the europeans
as far as video games are concerned we call upon the member states to continue to promote the rating of video games again through selfregulation but if that is considered to be inadequate in some cases it should be backed up by the introduction of agreed minimum standards of content and promotion
it is fair to say that in each debate the news has been grimmer then in the preceding debate
thirdly it is also important to remember the fight against impunity above all because the many things that are being done in latin america will only yield positive results if impunity is also combated in parallel

despite the impact of the crisis there are still a substantial number of vacancies in europe but there is a lack of coordination both within and between the member states

however mr president of the commission there are also wellfounded concerns
and i hope that on this occasion it is not restricted solely to funding and supported activity in the rural field in the alternative crop sector but that it also allows us to cooperate and maintain greater supervision of the real effectiveness of the authorities in their fight against this type of crop
instead the governments should be asking themselves this who is really to blame
i am sorry but we have run out of time
i would like to organise my replies according to whether they are considerations for the immediate future or those for the hopefully near but rather more remote future
thirdly and finally the commission takes an extremely long time to respond to speeches and motions by members of this house
the link between equality economic growth and employment is very important and consequently the member states were called upon to expand child care and to reduce pay differentials and other genderrelated differences
this is demonstrated by the important victory of the serbobosnian candidate with views akin to those of karadzic that is to say a theorist of ethnic division and in some respects and with the appropriate distinctions not even izetbegovics victory guarantees the integrity of bosnia because his electoral campaign was conducted on the basis of a blend of personalism and nationalism which i consider dangerous
madam president i believe that the russian authorities should be told that we expect them to behave responsibly
please do not misunderstand me but the industrialised nations of the west should not take the moral high ground where turkey is concerned
the creation of this group which will start to work before the end of this legislative period gives a very clear signal of political will and political commitment at the highest level of this house to succeed in this regard
nonetheless today at last there is a convergence on common humanistic values of liberty equality and if not fraternity which would be too much to ask then at least mutual tolerance these are values which are recognised in a common area they are distinguished both from distinctly consumer cultures and from fundamentalist ones and are based upon the great traditions of christianity liberalism and socialism
so when i see reports that are predicated on the fusion of practice for fusions sake i must be concerned
this is because it is only through a description of specific cases that we can understand the problem
i think this is a good idea
the broad guidelines were adopted unanimously by all the member states at the last ecofin council
in writing the committee on legal affairs having examined the reasons for and against waiving the members immunity recommends that the european parliament should waive the parliamentary immunity of adrian severin while considering that until a final sentence is passed the member should be immune from any form of detention or remand or any other measure which prevents that member from performing the duties proper to the mandate
the establishment of civil society watchdogs in developing countries must be seriously looked at and i call on the commission to give the appropriate percentage of budget aid for such watchdogs
this proposal is designed to bring the regulation into line with the political statement made at the international maritime organisation in december by the presidency of the european union on behalf of the member states and of the european commission
which budget article do the corresponding amounts come from
we know that approximately people die on the roads each year because of driving under the influence of alcohol
she has raised her voice many times in calling for dialogue as the only way forward
in actual fact we have a budget for the development fund and in broader terms the development sphere where clear goals are lacking and where staffing levels are inadequate within the critical spheres which need to be worked on all of this sets the scene for enormous backlogs and for a control culture dominated by selfinterest and fear rather than actual results and a duty to achieve results and take action
this business could not exist in the eu
very finally i have not made any decision about opening a delegation in iran
of businesses in the european union have less than employees
it follows that as they shut themselves away in their glass towers eurocrats europhiles and ultraeuropeans of all kinds end up no longer having a grip on matters
so in order to have all this together we need a clear framework and we need a european framework
we have an enormous number of opportunities for greater cooperation but on an equal footing
mr president i shall be very brief with regard to this report
the commission communication on the structural indicators which present the most recent data on social exclusion and poverty stresses that in in greece the indicators relating to the level of poverty including social transfers the level of persistent poverty and the relationship between population incomes which involves the highest of earners and the lowest were higher than the community average this clearly highlights one very evident fact that the greek situation is worse than that of the rest of the countries of the european union
i thank him very much for the thoughtful and intelligent approach he took to the opening of this debate
nitrates pollution continues to be the biggest and the most expensive problem where the protection of european groundwater is concerned and so i regard it as seriously negligent of this house and the council too to fail to push the case for protection against nitrates in order to set ambitious targets for it but the fact that it has been confirmed and laid down that groundwater is as such to be protected constitutes a major triumph
so let us make it simple keep it simple but let us not do away with this solidarity fund
of course european citizens should be protected from these dangers too
one further point i am dissatisfied by the reduction of eastern policy to the northern and russian dimension to the exclusion of the issues of ukraine and belarus
i remember when germany and france came to an agreement it was not in my time about a candidate for the presidency of the commission it was the other one who left because it gave an impression of arrogance
madam president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the issue of state aid is raised every time there is a natural disaster

the liberal party of sweden my party in the national context is and has always been a driving force in this action and sweden actually achieves the target
that is why it is also disappointing that it has been difficult to get the commission to agree to increasing the budget so that we might appropriate this money and that is why we in the group of the party of european socialists have naturally endorsed the need to increase the amount to eur million and not eur million
these are also as a rule made available to the public via the ecbs website
at the moment however as we are faced with the financial difficulties that we are all aware of i think we should support the installation of the system at least along the main corridors that the european coordinator mr vinck has examined and proposed to us as the first step towards overall coverage
this is why parliament which is always committed to freedom and democracy in any part of the world must strongly condemn the autocratic and dictatorial policies of hugo chavez in venezuela
a recent study by eurostat showed that the cultural industry contributed significantly to the european economy

mr president after two and a half years of consultations discussions and conferences we have reached the point today when the commission can table a new directive to replace the television without frontiers directive

that seems technically feasible since iata has told us that it is reasonable to expect all airlines to be technically capable of introducing the new system within six months
this strategy is not a new one and long reflection on this matter reminds us that around years ago when similar policies and measures were presented as remedies we read and wrote that participation was a kind of red light at the end of a series of situations formed by a highly degenerated social situation to ask for basic solutions or giving rise to mere diversions which had precedents and has repetitions
mr president mr le maire mr borloo in recent months the eu has very much proved its worth
on june the commission published a communication about the reinforcement of police and customs cooperation in the european union
the situation in the balkans however clearly demonstrates that eu policy offers no solution that would prevent the division of the state while providing for the peaceful coexistence of all the ethnic and religious entities within it
peace and dialogue are two objectives which the european parliament has always supported
i commend mrs rothbehrendt for the attempt she made at a late hour to bring in compromises
it is also necessary to have the capacity to reexamine the cultural process on our continent
the sooner we do this the better it will be for everyone

i would like to say that it should make us stop and think when polish members of all groups and i am thinking in particular of the discussion among the liberals have said that what happened in poland is unacceptable but that the debate must be conducted primarily in poland itself and that poland itself is dealing with the unacceptable things that were said there
unfortunately there is no sign of this understanding in either the commissions or the european parliaments document

the presidency is convinced that there is an opportunity now to engage with turkmenistan and that approach is the only effective means of establishing a frank dialogue on issues such as human rights

mr president i do not think it detracts in any way from mr tannocks work when we conclude that this european neighbourhood policy in fact represents an enormous missed opportunity for the commission namely to ensure as a matter of priority indeed that our neighbouring country turkey is included in that policy occupying as it should first place and a very privileged one at that
the commission has voiced many doubts in this regard
now the eu must take decisions and measures to ensure that in future there is no repeat of this crisis with its impact on the member states
let us fight to ensure that positions of this
the hands of the major eu and nato powers are stained with the crimes they committed there in an operation that succeeded in creating hatred and warfare between peoples that had long before decided to unite their wills in order to build their country

it is hard to believe them because they are not in favour of a binding charter on the rights of consumers something that is incredibly important if citizens are to know what rights they have

this report contains proposals and wordings that reflect a liberal attitude towards drugs

creativity innovative technology and team spirit among the institutions industry the social partners and the research world are of course equally necessary

rapporteur in my meetings with european parliament secretarygeneral klaus welle i noted from the outset the efforts he made to resolve problems
this presidency had two faces
it is not just the european union that will implement reforms
the caucasus countries are working hard to rebuild themselves and the eu can must play a role in their reconstruction and expand our area of peace and prosperity to cover them also
what can the reason be for this retrograde step on the part of society
that is why we welcome it
we do not want kosovo eventually to join one of the neighbouring countries because this would not serve the interests of stability either
furthermore heads of state and government will emphasize the importance of involving all western balkans countries in regional cooperation and welcome a series of sectoral initiatives
they do not benefit from the overall development of the country so corruption which is widespread has to be challenged and fought effectively and seriously
it is vital that we learn the lessons that history has to teach us
in belarus sentences of capital punishment are still imposed and the death sentence is still in use
i should like to comment on the wider point that has been raised
i would like to reassure mr sterckx who is rightly concerned about the existence of prior agreements concerning his country of origin and the other benelux countries
for this reason we have included the issue of employment in our overall assessment and are calling for the decisions adopted at the luxembourg summit to be consistently implemented

when the day comes when the european parliament does not examine what the presidentinoffice of the european council is doing but rather what the heads of government that are not holding the presidency are doing in the councils we shall undoubtedly be dealing with one of the problems of the european union which is the lack of tenacity the lack of constant work on the part of all of the governments even though they may not be holding the presidency of the european council

even though it is not a question of discharge being refused at the present time the postponement is a consequence of the committee on budgetary control s not having been able to obtain adequate information on time of documents having disappeared and of the fact that there is so much that can be criticised in the financial and administrative spheres that the impression is one of dealing with a south american banana republic rather than with a supranational european organisation
a reduction in eu subsidies with the possibility of more support at national level should be the way forward in the future

commissioner mr presidentinoffice of the council let me give you an example of this if there were a change to the weighting of votes within the council which would mean that the countries with a higher population as well as the larger countries would in fact have more power and if the extension of qualified majority voting extended to the codecision procedure meant that this tendency in the european parliament also became more marked my question is what role will the european union s small or weak countries have in europe

first of all only two species are allowed to be hunted in the spring

the council has accepted parliaments amendment concerning the scope of the commissions report on the implementation of the directive almost in its entirety
but certain governments are hesitating certain governments have said lets see what ecofin ministers have to say about this report
so we must welcome the initiative taken by the committee on external economic relations and thank mr kreissldorfler for his excellent work
a ruling must be found however whereby sensible verifiable and economically acceptable support is possible
but at the same time these cutbacks mean that we are increasingly having to join forces at european level in order to maintain and afford the expensive technological innovations needed which we have to do if we are to remain competitive on the international market
please note in the minutes that my voting equipment failed and that i did of course vote for this report
we must have a wideranging debate to show that we are listening both to the views expressed by the irish people and to the views expressed in every other member state most of which if not all of which wish to proceed with this treaty
no one should expect the adoption of strict measures to produce immediate results
for a start never before have observers been invited so early on secondly the treaties explicitly provide for the accession date to be delayed and if that were to happen the observers would be here for rather more than two years and thirdly they would be with us when the commission presents its next progress report in which we can expect an answer as to whether accession is to take place at the beginning of or of and debating with observers present is not a good idea
i mention this because it was not quite clear
b by mrs malliori and others on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists on the forest fires in europe
in particular delays have been detected in the process of implementing the directive as well as considerable problems of interpretation regarding the scope of its application
policy goals are not clearly stated and the wording in places lends itself to ambiguity
the work is planned to start by the end of

the people have their expectations of europe and it is extremely regrettable that we will be unable to meet them
i would like to thank the commission sincerely for putting forward these proposals and i would like to draw attention to the fact that only twelve of the thirty or rather fortysix or so acts included in list have so far been submitted and we would ask you to submit the remaining thirtyfour acts as soon as possible so that we can deal with them
that is what we need to work on and that is what we need to build on because i greatly fear that any other effort we make to create an alternative will fail and will be a final failure which will be at the expense of the unification and progress of the european union
this shows in fact that there is a contradiction which is why i drew your attention to it given this contradiction i feel that what you read out which is gross national product must be right and not what was written in the original version which is gross domestic product which is quite different
let us have the courage to face up to the real problems and find solutions to them
we also have to work for peace in sudan where real genocide is taking place with the christians and the animists in the south doomed to famine and the civil war that is raging in the north

our aim must be a foot and mouth policy that is not anonymous
like you ladies and gentlemen the commission takes the view that the question of funding as well as the possibilities of reducing quantities of waste and cutting the cost of decommissioning are among the main related issues to which paragraph refers

the proposal for a council directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief disability age or sexual orientation would extend the protection against discrimination based on religion or belief disability age or sexual orientation to areas beyond employment

lastly i would like to make a comment on mr seppanen s concerns regarding the budgetary availability of resources for this type of aid
cofinancing and i know that for many of you this is a pet subject is not an appropriate topic for discussion in a debate on an annual budget it is something for the next financial perspective

this is the eighth time since the michelin affair in october that i have spoken in parliament to warn the council and the commission of the urgent need to confirm the social responsibility of companies and to establish meaningful rights for employees

to begin with mr varela suanzescarpegna referred to the scientific advice on which we base our proposal
from now on that information will have to be available so that we know exactly where we stand
mr fischler you reminded us that you will be in seattle the problem must therefore be considered at a much higher level
the reform proposal put forward by the commission is inadequate in this sense for it preserves the amount of aid completely intact

mr hegyi this is essentially not a procedural matter but since you have raised such a vital issue i would like to say that an announcement has already been made by the secretarygeneral regarding the possible presence of asbestos in our buildings
and the logical thing would be if we are holding a debate on budgetary guidelines to also debate the broad guidelines for economic policy
i voted for this report because in romania as well as in other member states we are sometimes faced with crises which affect public and animal health safety in relation to animal products such as transmissible spongiform encephalopathy dioxin swine fever and footandmouth disease
the very fact that the netherlands is accustomed to trying to reach compromises and consensus could make this dutch presidency an historic one

the european approach which favours a balance between demandreduction and supplyreduction measures therefore covers countries
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen qimondas difficult situation has been made worse by the emergence of the financial and economic crisis
meanwhile i congratulate you on your appointment and wish you luck
i am glad that this view was supported by our group and then by almost everyone in this house
the debate could start with the usual rounds of speakers from each political group but an hour halfanhour or even just ten minutes could be left at the end for a few extra speakers to come in by catching the presidents eye so that members who have sat here throughout the debate patiently listening to the arguments could come in and respond at the end somebody who has already spoken might wish to come back and respond at the end
because we are moving forward with a new plan at a european level there is some leeway for a slightly more fluid response to the difficulties we are facing with regard to the protection of the data
i think it is important that in the berlin declaration we make it clear that the problems and the challenges we are facing are there because of our success not because of failure
we have to keep this as short as possible
preventing confidential statistical information collected in this way from being used to respond to additional requirements would be as overprotective as trying to labour the point using the provisions of such a regulation this would just be in vain and would involve for example the need to limit the constraints imposed on people subject to the reporting obligation
turning to the rehabilitation phase during my visit i announced an initial amount of eur m in additional funds from the development budget of which to m will come from the ngo cofinancing budget line and the balance from redistribution of earlier edf funds

like the european parliament the commission is also extremely concerned about these international fishing pirates and the use of socalled flags of convenience
mr president some people may wonder why we are devoting time to discussing flooding even flooding on this scale in algeria
as commissioner verheugen emphasises there is nothing today to show that there are any problems in any of the ten countries which cannot be solved
while there are emission rights people can even speculate in them with overthecounter deals avoiding the exchanges entirely
nevertheless i believe parliament will be very interested in the opinion of the committee of european banking supervisors if the bank applies to it as the report suggests
i am also glad that the first meeting of the high level group on nuclear safety and waste management took place on october
however where are the actions of the services responsible for dealing with this phenomenon
these amendments restore the dignity of the nonlegislative text which of course has no repercussions
i shall look into what is happening in this case
the first thing is for the announced safety tests to be carried out quickly and transparently and for states to be required to close obsolete or unsafe plants
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen on behalf of our group i too should like to thank the rapporteur for the work she has done and i should like to focus on three issues while adopting a very practical and less political approach as many of my fellow meps have already mentioned
following the conciliation there is now a common commitment to solve the remaining problems in category by means of what is known as frontloading
the rights and privileges of this house and its members do not belong to us instead they are an asset which it is our responsibility to administer with great care and which must be weighed up against that other basic principle upon which our legislation and culture rest the principle of equality
i would ask you and other members to bear in mind when considering this issue and when it comes for debate that although gibraltar is part of the european union the residents of gibraltar do not themselves have direct representation in this parliament
the next item is the report by mrs jons on behalf of the committee on employment and social affairs on the proposal for a council directive concerning the framework agreement on fixedterm work concluded by unice ceep and the etuc c
in the light of this trend we have to ask ourselves whether the borderfree european union is actually taking advantage of all the opportunities it has to take action against this organised crime
the framework programme should lay much greater emphasis on the issues of social exclusion poverty ageing unemployment and the status of women
it is regrettable that the report does not condemn the war itself and hesitates between maintaining nato military forces on the ground and going ahead with their necessary withdrawal
a particularly important aspect of the reform of the legislation on medicinal products is improving pharmacovigilance
in writing we consider this resolution to be a good one and we propose to vote for it but we must draw attention to the absence of any important proposals and the insistence on others about which we have major doubts
mozambique is in the same position
i repeat the new democracy party did not oppose the european support mechanism of the european union and the international monetary fund
the fact that the presidency wishes to reform the eus ossified structures is cause for optimism

the irish registry will carry a disproportionate share of flights on our books due to the size and geographic spread of some airlines as the airlines particularly ryanair are registered with the irish aviation authority for all of their eu operations
i welcome the discussion on this report
in awareness of this all members of parliament involved in this process have cooperated with one another showing a good example the two committees reinforced their cooperation and appointed two excellent rapporteurs and then starting from the organisation of the public hearing to the voting they did everything they could to achieve a result
for the time being it seems that the political will has been found to implement the european growth initiative quickly which includes a raft of quickstart projects in research and development transport energy and information technology
i believe that could become a confidenceinspiring move
we can no longer allow ourselves to rely solely on the effectiveness of national laws and the efficiency of investigative forces from individual countries but we need more coordination
the push for implementing european union strategy on defencerelated industries is clearly aimed at boosting arms sales and finding new markets for eu arms manufacturers
i think we are agreed on the need for this regulation and for the need to get it in place as soon as possible so that the traditional acp suppliers can continue their efforts to improve their competitiveness
both reports seek to address two aspects of this complex problem fuel quality and the reduction of exhaust gases
this time the european unions position is clear and this parliament has given overall support to a reduction in emissions by and a reduction by
our next step must be to convince young people especially young women not to go down this road
in all areas covered by the stability pact and therefore also in the economic and trade areas reciprocal commitments between donors and recipients remain the key to the stability pact s success
this is to be welcomed but we would like the same zeal to be applied to economic governance
naturally we must not confuse the appropriate protection of the consumer with the undue protectionism that any particular member state may want or may employ in any event however it should be pointed out that every member state has the right to regulate the phenomenon of betting for money on its territory until such time as another europeanlevel legal instrument appears
they will be deprived of financing
in fact the eib also finances projects in outside regions contributing to the realisation of eu external objectives as regards cohesion and development policy

i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on monday december

on behalf of the pse group tomorrow we shall have a unique opportunity to take a historic step in the fight against discrimination by saying no to this phenomenon
at this stage we want to follow these events very closely
you mentioned measures to be taken by the council what can you tell us mrs van dok about those measures
nowadays member states are facing economic financial and social crises creating the need more than ever for solidarity and respect for the unions basic principles
it appears to us completely unacceptable that the achieving of a goal as essential as that of the closure of a supremely hazardous power station should be deferred for purely technocratic and budgetary reasons
but i will give you the floor as the last speaker
if strategy is to be based on quantity then countries like austria from which i come can never succeed in tough competition with the big agricultural countries we must instead go all out for quality the highest possible quality products from a highquality environment
it is inexplicable in my view that they will be subject to border police controls for a further two to three years
we can manage without this crossdepartmental unit
this proposal is as follows the council can adopt the commissions initial ideas and parliament will withdraw its opposition to them
the absence of common rules in various member states has given way to fragmentation of legal frameworks which is harmful for both consumers and manufacturers and in fact prevents the realisation of a common market
space is also a tool as you have indicated that allows europe to be united around a common ambition and to develop a european identity
tell us frankly what your intentions are with regard to the european parliament
however this is clearly an issue that needs to be carefully prepared at the highest political level
the eurobarometer which we always ignore tells us as much
to persevere with the policy of european subsidies however represents
this brings with it both opportunities to enlarge the union further and first and foremost serious problems regarding the question of kosovos independence
we need the european company legislation and not least we need to adapt our social security systems to the new reality of a common europe because this too forms the basis of what we call the social model namely a social market economy for europe
because the network system can bypass the democratic system or be out of reach of democracy
tourism must be environmentally friendly if it is to continue to be an asset in the future
they are small states but their representation will automatically exceed that of the basque country that of flanders that of scotland that of wales
following the entry into force of the treaty of amsterdam does the council now intend to press for a comprehensive eu combat poverty programme and to what extent will it support eu action for housing and the homeless
we need to remove the threat of indigenous coal mining coming to an end and instead enable this strategic sector to survive in a reasonable manner
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i would like to offer my sincere thanks for the statement that has been given here on behalf of the high representative and to which i actually have very little to add
i would like to ask the commissioner why the commission did not react any sooner
indeed the number of attacks and killings particularly against women is on the increase
i can foresee a large role for such an observatory and i would therefore like to see a proactive approach to dealing with it and i would call on unice the organisation of european employers in particular to show more commitment and some more enthusiasm
however i am not sure if we should give more money for research
having said that however we cannot forget that behind the legitimate requirement for more effective means a temptation could be hiding for after infecting europe with unfavourable forms such as organized crime as mr orlando said europe could be infected with other viruses legal substantialism that of legal short cuts comprising exceptional laws suspensions and compression of the right to the protection of individual rights
the country is slowly recuperating economically and most probably it will meet the objectives by the date of accession
we went to afghanistan with one objective to dismantle the alqaeda training camps the support base of international terrorism which were threatening us and threatening stability in the region
this is a result of the time lag which exists in the field of agriculture whereby expenditure takes place one year later
i hope that the commissioner can commit to this today
it considers that only a negotiated settlement can gradually restore civil peace and enable the presidential elections to be held so that the institutions can function normally again
the whole of the ecologically sensitive alpine region needs our support within the terms of the alpine convention
one of the main tasks of the food and veterinary office is to monitor the observance of food hygiene and veterinary and plant health legislation within the eu and elsewhere
it has taken five years but the eu appears finally ready to pass a law on this important issue
i believe that the committee on economic and monetary affairs has achieved a good result and in view of the lateness of the hour i would also like to come to a conclusion
in many cases companies use the argument of negligence rather than saying it is deliberate but in fact negligence in its way is deliberate
as a result the overall volume of loans under the progress microfinance facility will amount as planned to around eur million
the unions enlargement is a unique opportunity to turn the cap from a museum piece into a dynamic forwardlooking policy
mr president commissioner of course i fully support what mrs schierhuber has described to us so excellently
genetically modified foods will remain a game of russian roulette for people suffering from allergies
i am grateful to mr michel and ask him to pass on to the commissioner responsible my thanks for having accepted a couple of amendments but i feel really frustrated by what we have debated here
i will therefore ignore her remarks with regard to kyoto
furthermore the council agreed with the commissions opinion that defining annual resettlement priorities has only an implementing nature because essentially this means that the detailed rules in the decision are applied to specific situations
we have got to the point now in october where there is almost a desperation to try and find some solution
political and military colonization and just see what happened in the discussion between france and the united states over the nato southern command
however we must also say yes to the research innovation and education area in other words to the greater europeanisation of education and research policy
a year ago at the time of the lake constance air disaster we saw what tragedies could result from the introduction of the law of profit into this field even if only to a limited extent
the public no longer have any concept of the overall shape of european railways
what i see as the most important element in this debate is that there is a broad consensus on the importance of relations between the european union and the united states as well as on the need to strengthen them not only through a joint agenda to tackle serious challenges and serious conflicts but also through new institutional mechanisms
however the report continues to defend the ecb and its guidelines even making major contradictions that is why we voted against it
thirdly we must start planning ahead now for the day when zimbabwe has a legitimate government and will need a broad package of international support
we have been presented with a series of alarming reports to the effect that different chemicals produce diseases and that they can for example affect our ability to have children
nevertheless there has been insufficient political will to give the ombudsman proper working conditions
we cannot start from the premise that the direct and indirect costs of people working in poor conditions should be met by society leaving the capitalists with the increased profits from having their employees work in such conditions
that is why i have read it out and i am grateful that you have given me the chance to make clear the significance of this vote
on behalf of the ppede group mr president i am no pacifist anybody in this chamber who knows me well would say that but there is much about warfare and the arms trade which we must regret
thus our political dialogue was formalised and the way was open to implement the cooperation agreement also known as a third generation agreement in full
thirdly it is also an expression of the special relationship between the former ec member greenland and the union
i refer again to the dprks nuclear programme
we started the first european semester with our annual growth survey and this should be the last piece of the puzzle
at present we really do not know
external factors however such as the increase in oil prices are playing an important part in this development
in the policy itself the focus should be on the fight against human trafficking and illegal immigration
the social fund has allocated resources for this
mr president ladies and gentlemen before addressing the councils presentation of the draft budget after its first reading i should like to say that the cooperation between the council parliament and the commission over the conciliation on legal bases which we will be debating shortly has been exemplary
madam president i welcome this report and i commend the rapporteur on his excellent work
on the one hand brussels is demanding that people become more mobile and is wanting to shift traffic from road to rail but on the other hand it is trying to bring into play precisely the opposite development with the magic formula of privatisation
in a spirit of openness the valencian government has also invited the european parliament to put forward any suggestions it considers necessary
therefore i think that if at the moment i am hoping to reach i will actually reach
in writing in an eu characterised by the deterioration of the social and economic conditions of its workers and the population as a whole and in which wealth concentration inequalities and poverty continue to increase it is significant that neither the commission nor the majority in this parliament considers the fight against this unacceptable situation to be a major priority
that should not be forgotten
i know from her extensive experience in dealing with food safety issues in this house that she will be aware that similar sensitive provisions have been included in the hygiene regulation
a link of confidence between the political class and its people has been broken
we thank you for all you have done and i thank mr hernandez mollar and other colleagues on the committee for everything they have done over the last few years
i say this because when presenting it the presidency knew full well that it could not possibly be used as a basis for credible work it is so unfair and shortsighted
the council has still not delivered an opinion
thus in the commissions view it is neither necessary nor appropriate to change the deficiency payments regulation
i also think that kemalism has two sides a positive side which supports a republican secular state and rejects religious domination in this case that of islam over the civil authorities
needless to say however we expect the commission and the country itself to make every effort to eliminate corruption which and this is the sad thing extends into political circles
i had hoped it was a byproduct of the impersonal translation process but from what i have heard it seems that there are no openings that there are no hopes that there is a gulf
our question to the council and the european union is the following are people really prepared and able to make thorough preparations that is to say in all those areas and not just in the first two of them
we have to keep the price of carbon high to encourage research innovation and substitution
moreover it is also important to put in place an effective control mechanism as part of the application of the human rights clause
however amendment only in so far as it calls for quantity to be replaced by weight to define the level of bycatch is acceptable
the eu and the member states could have shown not only with words but also through action their commitment to the fight that the united nations has embarked on in order to end poverty and hunger in the world

we are very grateful for the work that our rapporteur ms patrie has carried out
the uk governments upgrading of trident fundamentally undermines the eus collective position on nonproliferation and therefore both the uk and indeed france should be strongly condemned by both the council and the commission
lastly we need to reform our legislation on mergers and acquisitions which takes no account of their social and geographical impact
despite the generally positive tone of the report i cannot support it
because knowing that health is the responsibility of member states the european citizens wish certain tasks to be performed at european level since it is only at this level that they can be performed properly
the density of the environmental pressures the presence of sensitive species in the strait the political sensitivity of the area and the risk of further similar accidents in the future all underline the need to assess the situation in a more comprehensive manner
mr president eu transport policy is on the wrong track
we will not be part of this hypocrisy
mr president listening to the uk independence party talking about the commission not being able to manage its grandchildrens pocket money i must say that i would rather have the commission managing it than the uk independence party
i think in all legislation it is important in particular that we have a great concern
the list is very much longer and would require more than the three minutes i have available but what it boils down to is that we sometimes have the impression that the member states do not comply with the requirements of a strict and consistent control policy
i talked in my speech about a common culture from a diplomatic perspective as part of a political culture
the united states also bears that responsibility within the international institutions the united nations and under international law
it would be very sad if requests for exceptions upset this fragile document which is so necessary for europe and the entire world
mr president we are here debating a very peculiar creature
on the situation in the great lakes region and in particular on rwanda and the situation in burundi
this is an historic occasion and i am particularly pleased to be speaking on behalf of the group of the european peoples party and european democrats the largest group in the european parliament and a group that has made a major contribution to the enlargement of europe
there are however serious policy differences between what the commission is now proposing and what was agreed at the ecofin council in helsinki in when it was agreed that member states determine their budgetary policies in consistency with the treaty but that this commitment leaves room for domestic policy choices
at the same time brussels too is clearly more than just an element for consideration by the commission in this process
in this particular case i think that changing the conversion rates will simplify matters and offer transparency while the negative effects will be very small
children of the regimes leaders are allegedly attending expensive british boarding schools the new partnership for african development and the eu troika have been supine in galvanising regional particularly south african and nigerian opinion against the president
the goal of achieving a stable and prosperous democracy in turkey is not only in turkeys own interests but is also an important strategic interest of the eu
greyhounds raised for racing in ireland are frequently exported to spain once they have come to the end of their racing career where they are treated appallingly and with scant regard for their welfare from the spanish authorities
however we must ask why a normal principle and a normal right which are enshrined in the treaty are not being recognised
while sport and the number of competitions are left unregulated drugs will be used
should not the contributions be reduced for women who do not smoke or for women in general simply because there tend to be less of them in prison using up taxpayers money
however this is only the beginning
gay rights are now part of law an antitrafficking law has recently been passed and domestic violence law has gone through
i hope this will happen soon
i would like to emphasise the danger that accompanies a onedimensional approach on this matter while at the same time favouring the creation of a platform at eu level for the purpose of exchanging information and best practice
in paragraphs and minimum income has been translated by the swedish word minimilon which means minimum wage
when you present your college of commissioners and the division of responsibilities we will tell you whether we are for or against but today you have our full support
i should like to compliment the commission on its intention to put the broad strategic objectives such as prosperity solidarity and security at the centre of its activities in the long term
the hebrew state scientists are apparently attempting to identify the distinctive genes carried by some arabs then create a virus or bacterium which would affect that specific population
madam president i oppose religious persecution wherever it occurs
should this breakdown be attributed to a lack of information
what does it mean to patent a living albeit genetically modified organism
cooperation between the european union and the international labour organisation has therefore become a key item on our agenda
i am surprised
to achieve this however we will need million additional researchers at a time when many of them are attracted at the moment by noneuropean countries where there are mechanisms to remove the bottlenecks preventing ideas from reaching the market
without this involvement it will not be possible to combat climate change even if europe makes the most strenuous efforts
thirdly efficient transport is the lifeblood of the economy
i was already worried that the group had ceased to exist or had abandoned human rights policy
the elections will decide whether ukraine is to become a large version of poland a western european country with an open attitude towards democracy or a small version of russia which looks to the east and an authoritarian quasidemocracy
within a common framework a minimum common denominator the member states are going to define their own level of intervention enabling more efficient use of administrative capacity at national level
the woman is the basis of the family and any affront to women is a direct affront to the family the basis of our society
at a time when the whole of commercial and services law is being harmonized consideration must be given to the appropriateness of drawing up an international convention which removes the reference in the berne convention to resale right as a purely optional right
my second criticism follows on from the first
the only way to prevent that is through internal unity and cohesion peace amongst ourselves and our own solidarity and our own policies
russiaeu summit
i wish the new president luck
we must therefore support the political groups of philippine members of parliament who are going to present a draft abolishing the death penalty in that countrys congress so that that abolition can become a reality and the death penalty in the philippines can come to an end
mr president i would like to say that the spanish presidency has a series of objectives which are being presented straight away both in terms of the internal dimension of the project and of its external dimension
soon the shareholders of banks and insurance companies start benefiting from profits the retired bear the increased risk as a result of protective instruments being eliminated and the disadvantages of moving to a different employer or to another member state are not resolved
mr president we are in favour of both the market economy and competitiveness
today though as well as being without a house they are also without a tent because the tent which had been put up inside the courtyard of a palestinianowned house has twice been destroyed by israeli bulldozers
my colleagues responsible for regional policy enlargement and agriculture are presently examining these requests
let us think of the great difference in the form and depth of the seabed off the adriatic and the atlantic coasts the issue of multispecies fishing and the longstanding problem of fish sizes when rules on mesh and net sizes are already being obeyed
i hope you will allow me however to point out to this parliament that freedom of expression is sadly not only being jeopardized in cameroon in earlier resolutions this parliament itself wanted to restrict freedom of expression in particular in the resolutions which have become a boring tradition which under the guise of combating racism and xenophobia argue for muzzling legislation against people who do not necessarily and indiscriminately consider the socalled multicultural society as an ideal to be pursued
you may do so
my apologies to those whose reports have not yet been put to the vote but i think there is no longer any point
the strategy must moreover touch upon questions closely related to the social inclusion of roma such as environmental protection healthcare multiple forms of discrimination or antiroma attitudes expressed in the media and other areas of society
therefore this still does not make the judge a human rights activist she has never expressed herself on this point
mr president i would like to thank president juncker for his reply
this high level of participation demonstrates the appeal of the european research council and confirms that funding for frontier research on a bottomup basis corresponds to an urgent need in europe
there is one specific area that needs to be defined here and that is the prevention of repeat offending which falls somewhere between prevention and repression
that is also the reason why as soon as the berlin wall fell the union responded to the challenge and reacted decisively and proactively to the change in the european political landscape it offered a framework and prospects for a unified europe
i believe this is the case for most people here
the european defence agency has ideas on this subject
mr president there is a fundamental debate certainly but here we are simply involved in a procedural debate and we have to raise the question as to whether the draft which is submitted conforms with what was voted on within the committee on budgetary control
the development of energy and transport infrastructure investment in research and development learning and youth policy must find fresh impetus in the unions future budgets while the fundamental pillars of the cohesion policy and the agricultural policy should continue to receive the current amount of funding
the aviation emissions trading should not cause a decrease in the number of flights and an increase in prices negative consequences for passengers for the aviation industry and for the sustainable development of transports
i would like to repeat once again that decisions at eu level must not be determined by the financial markets
during its passage through the european parliament i have also been pleased to be able to present other improvements
i voted in favour of the present report and i consider it to be of great importance during a period of economic and financial crisis since it is necessary to ensure that all european union regions develop harmoniously
finally with regard to the visa waiver i would like to highlight a specific issue
we shall be voting in favour of this report because it proposes a policy of encouraging sex education and contraception because it clearly states that abortion should be legalised safe and accessible to all and because it calls on governments to refrain in any case from prosecuting women who have undergone illegal abortions
on the one hand azerbaijan demonstrates impressive economic growth which highlights the huge amount of oil progress in negotiations with the european union on an association agreement and participation in the euronest parliamentary assembly
the question is do we really want a european market where a third of the energy provided is renewable energy
the provisions of the amsterdam treaty on sustainability and its emphasis on the precautionary principle make it possible to intervene in the interests of health and the environment so that these principles take precedence in the approval of individual chemicals or product types
i wish at this point to pay tribute to mr schori who led this mission and to the remarkable work accomplished by his team
the report also provides support for among other things a strengthened budget to eradicate the bluetongue disease and assistance with european policing and antifraud
there is such a thing as established practice and the treaty gives everyone who wants to do so the right to make services available in another member state in full accordance mind you with the laws of that member state
so how should we do this
we will have the opportunity to discuss this with parliament
because of this regions geographic proximity to europe its ageold affinity its cultural diversity and its constant political instability the eu must act very firmly to ensure those fundamental principles
i wish to highlight the solidarity fund which has already been mentioned today and which we will certainly continue to speak about the fund is currently under review and it is hoped that drought can be included in its scope
i totally disagree with mr rehder when he said that the berlin summit had been a great success
my thanks to all my fellow members for this
they will eventually have to decide whether to join the european political and economic union
we are opposed however to individual superpowers or regional blocs independently pursuing military interventions outside the un framework for which the tindemans report unfortunately paves the way
germany lost the second world war and has put its efforts into household electronics instead of military electronics
i also think that we are still on the wrong track with regard to kyoto
moreover mr putin stated about months ago in the financial times that the problem facing russia was not that of the final status of chechnya but one of security
we must therefore argue that it is essential fully to guarantee the universal service with all of its quality of service and price conditions and also argue that account be taken of social and territorial cohesion and of the diversity of the current systems in terms of what is good about them they cannot all be homogenised
the commissions action in this regard is antisocial
so there is no longer any scope for a reduced ban as proposed in amendment no
i voted against the moraes report which reiteratesthe unrealistic guidelines contained in the commission communication on immigration integration and employment
selfsatisfaction and accusations of guilt attempts to gloss over mistakes and a superficial approach will not solve any problems or create any confidence
next year the agricultural budget will rise by only which is less than the average and that is despite the fact that for example there is eur million in the budget for the reimbursement of expenditure to member states because of foot and mouth disease and that a total of eur billion is available for the beef sector
as you know the great undertaking of constructing the single market has one primary aim making the european economy more competitive and so benefiting employment
in third place the issue of the lisbon strategy is a key problem for the future of the european union
fair and controlled competition can be allowed without territorial restrictions but with the necessary and suitable qualitative criteria for the collective management of copyright and the preservation of the value of the rights
europe certainly has to help if a solution is possible but overhasty interference leads to disaster
it is a report in which all these fundamental questions have been addressed and in which a path has been outlined for the eu to follow in its policy towards ukraine
there is so much work for us to do there
in opposition to the argument advanced regarding the increase in traffic this system might cause the isolation and disastrous creaming off of the more profitable sectors
the other question we had to examine was a legal one to what extent is the proposed system compatible with the right to respect for private and family life as defined in article of the european convention on human rights
any budgetary cut to the raphael programme is a blow to the possibility of creating new jobs
until now european bureaucracies and governments have said no to the introduction of the golden rule for fear of opportunistic behaviour by the member states
the latter have arranged their production in accordance with an artificial price in the european market and they must naturally be helped in the transitional period that will exist on the way to freer competition in the world market
on the other hand the european union will continue its efforts within the united nations organisation and the regional organisations such as asean
one the european union is not the driving force in the world here it is lagging a long way behind especially behind the united states educational establishments are underequipped in information and education technologies and in this sense we need to sound an alarm so that they go into top gear
no not at all but rather to show that similar situations exist in many other places
on behalf of the alde group madam president like my fellow member mrs krehl i congratulate you on your election and on your first sitting as president
unfortunately the proposals to promote a liberal economy will exacerbate the socioeconomic situation of the croatians
there are those in this parliament who oppose the constitution
i appreciate this and i gather that commissioner spidla can see why a law of this kind would constitute a threat to european values and an infringement of european law
in external relations respect for fundamental rights is a categorical condition of candidate countries accession to the union
they have raised all kinds of arguments that there was a government vacuum in europe that the market has been given preference over peoples health as we all know that the commission could have defended both the market and public health in the same way and at the same time
this is not worthy of europe
eur million are estimated to be required for renting renovating and furnishing a new building
we shall ensure that parliament is kept informed of the review of the technical specifications a point raised by mrs mcnally and with which we totally agree
finally let me stress again that i have followed the debate very attentively and that the presidency will convey the mood of this plenary to council members
as always greater attention should also be devoted to regions lagging behind
i am sure that if there is a strong will among the member countries to change das in the future here is an area where we need a solution
for the first time we now have uniform euwide rules which will ensure a faster exchange of information on criminal records and bring more legal certainty
that is where our european companies should be
mr president i have taken the message on board and i will pass it on to the commission president and the other commissioners
i have no option but to vote against the agreement drafted with the usa on humane animal trapping standards
generosity is incumbent upon the commission not the rapporteur
this house is very good at producing resolutions and legislation and we sometimes in this institution forget that europe cannot survive alone
i thank the committee on fisheries for helping us through this very difficult time
it also provides means to reduce animal testing and child labour
how often have we had to make do with talks with officials
these organisations could help to make consumer protection a central theme in the dialogue about regulation of the financial markets
we will not integrate a community perspective into the energy agreement with russia if we simply favour european firms and help them to make profits from russian energy supplies
as i have said animal suffering does not just begin with their transport and i can but ask mr fischler to continue on the path towards finally changing his agricultural policy to one which includes the rearing of animals in a way appropriate to their species finding a method of dealing with animals that is worthy of that description
would you mind giving me some more information
we have certainly realised this rather late but now we are at last able to separate increases in transport volume from economic growth
it is to be welcomed that we now finally have a political majority in parliament in favour of taking the consequences of the code of conduct which we adopted last summer and amending the houses rules of procedure so that we have clear rules on how lobbyists are to operate in parliament
it is in this area moreover that the structural funds have a central role to play specifically through their representatives in the different countries knowing how to practise mainstreaming and how to involve women in projects for otherwise there will be no projects beneficial to women precisely because the latter are not in the first place well disposed towards the market economy and the eu and because they have the historical background i have already described
i think that if we approach matters on this basis we will be on the right track
i am grateful to the rapporteur for having mentioned the european councils annual report calling for monitoring of these appropriations which we are promised year after year but which do not materialise it is time that the national budgets were adapted so that we might finally succeed in creating synergies in research
on this occasion i should also like once again to thank all the members of the romanian parliament who have been observers since september and members of the european parliament since january this year
and thirdly fingerprinting infringes the integrity of the person and should only be done where it is genuinely necessary
at that time defence of the status quo was the soviet unions primary objective while for russia today the primary objective is to change the status quo to its own advantage
however there are three countries india israel and pakistan that remain outside the regime and we continue to call upon them to accede unconditionally to the npt as nonnuclear weapon states
i am delighted that the current draft incorporates of parliaments requirements by excluding from its scope noneconomic services of general interest certain social services and healthcare services
there is a possibility of exchange of scientific information and of exchanges in the policy of training of research workers which i think might be enormously profitable for both the kingdom of morocco and the european union
today in june the commission is asking the council to endorse a very inadequate and unsatisfactory agreement with canada and russia and nothing at all with the united states
the report points out that individual member states are losing influence over monetary policy and also over financial policy
mr president ladies and gentlemen i can be brief about the oomenruijten report
i shall say three things about that strategy
i thank the presidentinoffice for her answer although i think it falls far short of satisfying not only me but even herself since so little has been done by the union about such a vast problem tragically little
i have to say mr president that the first altener programme and later the white paper on renewable energy sources which has developed community strategy and the action plan for have been possible thanks and i repeat to the cooperation between our two institutions parliament and the commission and that the new european union renewable energy policy has been put together precisely as a result of a good understanding between us
this is clearly unstable but it is one of peace due to the presence of the military forces it is clear that there are certain situations in which attempts to deflect ethnic tensions can only be successful by using mechanisms which involve the protection and separation of the waters
the union will be more open more effective and more democratic
what the were unable to agree at nice will certainly be impossible for to agree at the future igc
despite being unable to comment on the substance i would venture to refer to what the council said earlier namely that we are extremely keen for a decision on the new financial regulation to be made as quickly as possible
mr president much has been said today on the subject of humane treatment and to what extent we are a civilised society
however it is also the moral and political duty of the union many of whose member states share a common history with the african continent to oppose criminal abuses such as certain interpretations of the sharia law and to support using every effort and every means at our disposal those who are fighting for the rule of law for rights and for real justice for all
it would be horrendous if a child were to suffer or even die because an inadequately tested product was allowed on the market and we have to remember that items such as toothpaste and medicated shampoos are classified as cosmetics
the contribution of all of the member states and the commission represents a little over of the global fund
we have had the speech by the president of the commission and we have had the hearings but the second stage is the work programme of the european commission
you are going at such a furious pace that we cannot put our hands up in time in order to vote
the inconsistencies between the first and third parts of the constitution the limitations and full implementation of the charter of fundamental rights the potential conflict between the president of the commission and the president of the council the retention of the power of veto in too many areas of competence the exclusion of the european parliament from the ratification process these are all serious steps backward courteously guided by the irish presidency
i would like to hear your answer to this question
in the case of the economic reforms which are on the agenda in the former socialist states a situation must therefore be prevented in which the burdens of change again affect those in society who are least able to defend themselves
mr president i see two problems with this morning s debate
so please let us be consistent
firstly because other portuguese citizens such as commissioner antonio vitorino could be in this position and secondly because our shared duty in this house our duty and yours is to represent the common interests of europes citizens
strangely however in the dream mrs pack was married to three members of the european parliament who are sporting champions mr mennea mr messner and mr vatanen
he states and i am quoting from his explanatory note to the amendments that it is too important an issue to handle in two sentences flat which is saying something completely different
why should we do that
he has done an excellent job and has in particular been able to strike a balance between the costs connected with safety measures and the major safety measures which must be taken in tunnels in the next few years
that is phraseology that would immediately lead to a discussion about deferral
with regard to visa facilitation we have begun talks in the council
i welcome very much as others have said that we can celebrate the success of the antirabies vaccination campaign which has allowed us to get to the point we are at today and which allowed initially the uk ireland and sweden to change their quarantine system thereby giving us the template that the commission now proposes to extend effectively throughout the eu
i think we all need to keep up our efforts to bring about democratic change in turkey
the possibility of transferring or exchanging allocated fishing quotas must continue to be a member state competence
i am impressed by the figures that robin teverson gave us in relation to the cost per job and per vessel of this agreement
we just manage less and less often to convert these ideas into real products
i want to underline what mrs wallis has already said
portugal has pointed out the significance of brazil which has traditional ties with europe as well as a vast development potential
a transitional coalition is an african approach that has over the years worked in a number of other countries such as togo and the democratic republic of congo
moreover the best practices of different experiences of green belts around cities particularly in africa are currently being analysed in the context of the great green wall for the sahara and the sahel initiative as part of a feasibility study supported by the european commission
furthermore going along with the proposal to delegate the management of nuclear waste to third countries ukraine or russia for instance is irresponsible
i should like to congratulate the rapporteur mr rosati on the integrated proposal which he has submitted on this matter and i think that the house should vote in favour of his report tomorrow
however this report and these proposals indicate that our poorest regions could win twice over from enlargement with a bigger internal market and a continuation of regional aid
we need to distinguish between supervision and regulation and in terms of supervisors we need better coordination at institutional level
in general at the level of heads of state or government as the treaty of lisbon states very clearly it is for the president of the council to represent the european union in cfsp matters at this level and in that capacity and for the commission to represent the european union in all other external matters as set out in article of the lisbon treaty
the collection of information is important to prevent awful atrocities such as those we have seen in madrid
the rules on liquids are ineffective and arouse great opposition
it is for this crucial debate that the european parliament is calling and it is in these substantive discussions that as the representatives directly elected by million europeans we intend to fully participate even if this displeases certain governments who wish to deny us this right
as far as i am concerned these agreements are sacred
we condemn that and i hope that when president menem visits brussels in the coming months he will clarify these events for us
the presidency did not see the logic of this firstly because it was not specifically agreed at amsterdam and secondly because there have been precedents since the maastricht treaty that matters requiring a unanimous decision in the council such as the structural funds and the cohesion funds could still be adopted by parliament by codecision
i believe that this is an extremely important issue and i hope the house will support our move
the end of the cold war has not brought an end to excessive support for arms manufacturers instead the eu has pushed along with the us to expand nato and to find new justification for arms manufacturing and weapons exports
we in the commission also very much welcome parliaments motion for a resolution it is a firm constructive statement of parliaments commitment to gender equality
if a politician expresses noxious views it should be up to his constituents to remove him not the courts let alone his political opponents
we asked for clarity about the subject of super commissioners a better gender mix in the commission and a commitment to transparency and individual accountability for commissioners
i also wish to praise this initiative by denmark which seeks to ensure that a framework decision on combating serious environmental crime is approved
i think we must have another look at all this so that we can devote all the time they deserve to important debates
the member states should therefore make use of the european qualifications framework to improve the lifelong learning programmes
as the bearer of that gift i must say that i do not feel i have given my colleagues a present because it is very difficult to unite the analyses and thoughts of fifteen different political structures in one line of action as you know
however we the parliament and in particular the group of the social democrats want lisbon to go one step further now
it should be remarked that no strategy papers or indicative programmes have been adopted for libya and the palestinian authority as mediumterm programming is not possible in those cases and therefore the appropriations stated are only position numbers
however i welcome this report
i commend the president of the ecb because he has paid heed to the discussions and reports in the parliament and recognises our direction and determination
communication with the press is the name of the game and so far nothing has been done in this area perhaps because the commission does not have the nerve to speak out against certain national governments
human rights and democracy are vital to our continued support for developing nations
the commission will then consider whether to put forward a proposal for a comprehensive directive covering the inspections life cycle
will they accept such assessment and such an annual investigation
so why not intervene straight away
i have already been in touch with the chairman of the committee on budgets to try to arrange for the allocation of million which has to be found in the budget without damaging other important ongoing programmes that in fact often benefit the same countries that we want to help with the additional eur m
i think this alternative way of spending development funding is an excellent idea
despite this in the runup to the election opposition groups and nongovernmental organisations were subjected to much tighter rules on the right of assembly and peaceful demonstration
and for this the convention needs to be amended
i agree with you mr madlener that human traffickers should be arrested and that turkey really should set up a decent asylum system a system that recognises political refugees who do not come from the european union but from elsewhere
in writing madam president ladies and gentlemen i voted in favour of mr belets report on community participation in the european audiovisual observatory
the problem of the counterfeiting of goods and the unauthorised use of other peoples intellectual property is still widespread it is particularly difficult in the case of intangible property such as the copyright to musical and literary works and patents
i would also like to congratulate you commissioner on the reference you made to the specific nature of the common position on cuba since this parliament and certainly my parliamentary group have opposed the embargo policy of the united states government and the helmsburton act in particular
this money will hopefully go some way towards covering those costs
this position must become the position of all of us peoples and governments alike of both the and the and that is because in certain cases sometimes overt and sometimes concealed opposition is being expressed on the basis of historical atavism or by reviving past antagonisms andor enmities
furthermore as mrs beres pointed out so superbly it is imprudent and dangerous to improvise at voting time by proposing in plenary the adoption of concepts which as it happens were neither discussed nor even raised in committee
i entirely agree
safety concerns are of course not restricted to nuclear energy
today your actions do not speak in your favour
the whole interpretation has been made available for your inspection
it should be emphasised moreover that many victims suffer injury twice first as the victims of a crime and then as victims of an excessively bureaucratic system and this system requires greater simplification in order to prevent situations where protection is unavailable or inadequate
mr president i voted in favour of adopting the modified version of the draft services directive
we question the effectiveness necessity and proportionality of this measure
in so doing the eu has begun to regulate one of our most popular leisure activities
the loopholeladen agreement has left lots of wiggle room for tehran effectively providing perfect diplomatic cover for the mullahs to gain the most precious thing they needed to advance their weapons programme time
nevertheless i should also like to thank the finnish presidency for its contribution at the time and particular thanks are due to the french presidency in that case the french transport minster was a knowledgeable railway enthusiast
a strategic objective is also there for us all to see
mr president since it now transpires that the commission is still uncertain as to how much time it is prepared to give parliament i would given that we have not yet reached the final vote like to ask you to refer the report back to the committee on employment and social affairs which will make some more consultation with the commission possible
one aspect of the bosch report of particular concern to us is the followup to critical comments
it would therefore help if we had some real assessments of the impact of the application of this directive in terms of employment regional life and also consumer prices because everyone can see that energy prices like transport prices are increasing all the time even though we were told that competition would bring them down
i would draw your attention to the fact that all the positions i have just outlined are the result of lengthy detailed council debates that took place a long while before the parliament approved its statute on june
on behalf of the inddem group when all the doors are closed you can always find a way in at the back
some members have already mentioned the compulsory installation of the digital tachograph under the tonne mark
however turkey too has serious obligations
to make the statement that the european parliament in particular not just the council and commission commits to proposals in this area seems to me very important
that is immoral and an important chance to make a move towards reconciliation may have been wasted
i have been to kurdistan
let us focus on those areas in which the eu can add value to peoples quality of life and living standards
we have thus been able to contribute to the preparation of countries seeking accession for eu membership
i want the chinese to listen to the words of my colleagues and to this resolution on religious freedom
finally we held a hearing in march in the european parliament with a senior member of the house of lords committee of inquiry into structural funds in the uk and the cohesion funds in the eu they presented their preliminary findings to our committee
ecrussia readmission agreement
this deplorable approach is now engraved on the heart of the new common agricultural policy
the european parliament has undertaken a great many initiatives since in connection with a complete ban on this murder weapon which exterminates human lives and prevents economic development
as many speakers mentioned the issue of energy efficiency i want to repeat what i already said in my introductory remarks in april we will come forward with a proposal that will be focused on climate change and energy efficiency issues a review of the energy taxation directive and the green tax package proposing reduced vat rates for green services that are aimed at increasing energy efficiency
we also have the situation of a more precise legislative programme since the pdb and we need to assess the changes
and we have here an initial opportunity where the european parliament has already stated that it is prepared if at all possible and if the council meets us half way here to complete the legislative procedures at first reading
therefore we must not only ensure that slovakia maintains a durable inflation rate but also see how the inflation rate can be reduced as much as possible in all the countries already in the euro area
the final conclusion of the agreement has not happened before now for various reasons firstly because other agreements under negotiation with liechtenstein had not been concluded secondly because there was a dispute on the legal basis and later because of the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon
mr president we all agree in this house that television is a critical industry not just in itself but in its influence upon european society culture and the economy
the aim of the commission is by the end of the current year to submit a motion for a resolution for joint rules concerning the electricity produced by renewable energy sources
this is a sign of political inadequacy in the european parliament
this is completely unrelated to what is really happening on the ground
the first part of amendment no is not acceptable because there is no case for the adoption of a quantitative target in respect of this measure
one which favours maximum speed in putting goods through customs at the cost of control and the possible loss of customs duties and another which reverses those priorities
this includes nato which the report does not cover
we regard that as a serious defect of the commissions proposal
now in our regulatory texts leaving aside the amendment of the regulation we will be voting on tomorrow the way in which the budget discharge procedure is regulated is set out in black and white for all to see one may disagree with it but that is the way it is if a text is tabled in this house and the proposal to which it refers is rejected the proposal is referred back to the committee responsible
we may not be able to bring back the dead but we can ensure that nationalism is never given another chance in cyprus
foodstuffs
combating climate change and promoting ecoinnovations also means in the medium term kickstarting europes economy and industry
what they are looking to do is to control international trade within the framework of capitalist competition in such a way that the large economic and financial groups would be in control of a countrys economy its agriculture its industrial production its services and its natural resources
in it he literally referred to the flechard case as an irregularity and then connected it with the court of auditors failure to give a positive statement of assurance concerning the commissions budget management
we cannot accept this kind of political persecution of mr diaz de mera consuegra who has a distinguished record in combating crime and defending justice as a professional in his own member state and who has been an outstanding member of this house
this should speed up legislative decisionmaking and as a consequence enable us to advance along the road mapped out by the institutions following the single european act
madam president i am very pleased that we have finally been able to adopt a clear stance on matters in kosovo with a very large majority
establishing the energy community is in many ways a rational and justifiable project
the automotive industry in the european union including both car manufacturers and car part manufacturers must remain economically efficient and innovative
and even if we were to deploy all of the naval assets of all of the countries of the european union i would not be certain of absolute success
in this connection i am perhaps particularly thinking about the laval case
i am therefore entirely satisfied with this report which i would ask you to support
in this respect the ecommerce directive can be reviewed separately from the review of the consumer acquis and i assure you that i will follow this subject very closely with fellow commissioner mccreevy within whose portfolio lies the ecommerce directive
however demands are already being made to offer this to younger women as well this shows how important european guidelines are
mr de rossa although this is not strictly speaking a point of order if mr spidla is able to answer this question in seconds i shall give him the floor
this new measure is in line with the logic of the eu member states immigration and asylum policy as practised since which is notable for its permanent dismantling of migrants rights
at the same time we realise how important the swift agreement is for completely different reasons
because today democracy is not the right of everyone to be equal it is the equal right of everyone to be different
the launching of a new governance cycle gives us the opportunity to reflect on the path we intend to follow
nevertheless i shall not hesitate to make my concerns known to all my fellow commissioners inviting them to determine as soon as possible the strategy to be followed
if the eu wants to be able to make a tangible contribution let it appoint a special envoy for burma
similarly we will have to look at the possibility of the suspension of development aid because that is how the cotonou agreement would suggest that we should proceed
nevertheless we shall continue to speak out against health professionals being used to distribute to their patients brochures and information that have been supplied by pharmaceutical companies without any checks by health authorities
in the member states signed the unece convention on access to information public participation in decisionmaking and access to justice in environmental matters the aarhus convention
i welcome the goal of creating a legislative framework that makes it possible inter alia to identify timber products and ensure their traceability to establish independent and governmental verification procedures certifying that all timber products exported by the republic of congo to european markets have been procured felled transported and exported legally with the aim of establishing the foundations of legal management and exploitation in the congos timber sector and to strengthen forest law enforcement and governance
thank you minister
i should like you to elaborate a little on what you said on that point
mr president on a procedural matter
these tasks are basically european ones that show why european cooperation is needed
that would be more productive and i do not like seeing the various committee agendas that are already overloaded being cut again and again because of this kind of showpiece
today in most countries quality costs a great deal of money and implies private facilities
i am sure mr ribeiros report will be an important document
few measures that can be taken against an individual are as farreaching in their effects as legal proceedings or the requirement to serve a sentence
finally we must draw attention in this context to the attitude of the united states of america which are constantly and unacceptably blackmailing the commission in order to obtain even greater advantages for their rice
a little more dynamism would certainly not go amiss therefore
i therefore call upon the commission to take action to ensure that the schengen agreement is respected and that the bureaucratic interference of the italian authorities ceases
this issue emfs is indeed very controversial in the eyes of many european citizens although many others us included also see it as being most important
human rights are not just for our benefit
as far as the broadcasting of television programmes is concerned the internal market does not exist
the election of a president by his or her peers on the european council marks an unexpected strengthening of the intergovernmental structure the latter should actually be weakening as europe moves forward
as shadow rapporteur for our group i am pleased that we were able to be successful in this regard
none of this will bankrupt anyone in the european union
any further funding for spain portugal and ireland from the cohesion fund is therefore neither justified nor in view of the enlargement of the union feasible
i regret the statement today by the commissioner i hope over the next few months to persuade him that he is wrong that we do need a dynamic process that we do need a high level taskforce which includes not only himself and other dgs but members of civil society the trade unions the council and the committee of the regions
so to conclude i think the report is an excellent step an excellent resource and an excellent way of starting out on the road to democratizing community institutions
mr president ladies and gentlemen france is a beautiful country and strasbourg is a wonderful city with splendid people interesting architecture and fine monuments
lack of knowledge of community law amongst lawyers judges and public prosecutors is not just a problem for the professionalism of these professions but also a risk for the ordinary citizen for businesses and for the functioning of the internal market
madam president representatives of the council and the commission globalisation is good for europe europe must encourage globalisation
i would like to pick up on a number of points built on what the commissioner said
we will do what is in our mandate as far as agriculture is concerned
but it would be pointless to harass small family farms with this
million people are infected there
people do not like to use the words class actions and neither do i but a european right of collective redress might help give us the confidence for consumers that is currently lacking on this continent
mr president i am very pleased that parliament has taken up the question of combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography seriously
this criticism has now died down which is all to the good provided that it is based upon considerations of efficiency rather than on constructive criticism that is not allowed to come to the fore
consequently it cannot be the task of the eu or the european parliament to establish rules on the gradient of steps how they are placed in relation to buildings or the fact that they must not rest on a slippery surface
now the committee on the environment has opted for september and i think that we can agree to this date

mr president it is no longer a case of us having been sent a draft convention which does not correspond with what we are currently debating

legislation is still possible and frequently necessary but it is not the only option nor the most effective in all cases

the cultural and creative industries are currently also important drivers of economic and social innovation in many other sectors

would it be problems with the structures behind the governments efforts which are not satisfactory to you
another aspect which the legal affairs committee wanted to bring out was the matter of access freedom of access and nondiscrimination with regard to access by the consumer
and it does not always get it
the resolution adopted by this house which i referred to earlier established very clearly its criteria of judgment and debate with the commission and council and i quote it wishes to enhance rigorous and effective control mechanisms restricting production isolation stockpiling trade and trafficking of plutonium and weaponsgrade uranium and other nuclear material it wishes in particular to respect the situation regarding the environment and health with regard to nuclear safety and to take part in foreign and security policy with the highest priority to nuclear nonproliferation

thank you very much for this excellent report mrs grale
mr president as you so rightly say no question has been put
they must agree on mandatory targets to cut their emissions and at the same time find money to help developing countries deal with climate change
the question of data protection is addressed in articles and of the report
yet another example is climate change in contending with which the multilateral approach is the only way of acting effectively

we believe that the wording used in the report to describe this option is relatively vague and does not as such offer any guarantees that it would be used to create genuine european public opinion of the kind we would like to see
the real objective of the resolution was the desire to attack the italian government and only the italian government
a european legal area must be based on the principle of mutual recognition therefore the mere harmonisation of legal instruments is not sufficient

mr president mr presidentinoffice of the council except for the fact that you once used the term agriculture council you have actually succeeded in speaking for minutes without even once really mentioning the reform of agricultural policy as the agricultural spokesman for my group i do feel a little hurt
but there is a third element in this report on which i should like to dwell for a moment
in conclusion i would like to remind you that the target for an international agreement is not the celebrated reduction but and this ambitious target is also written into the agreement that we will adopt tomorrow
one final point today the currencies of the various countries could be viewed as subcurrencies of the euro but the banks do not see it this way today even on small amounts there is much more commission when buying and selling lira belgian francs or french francs than when buying dollars or pounds sterling
so i would ask you to put that to the house because i think other group leaders will confirm that there was no agreement on the matter in the conference of presidents
mr president i too would like to thank mr duisenberg for the quality of his work at the head of the european monetary institute
it is in this framework that the commission will discuss and adopt the preliminary draft budget for at the end of this month

mr president i am very happy to indicate that it is the intention of the presidency that the views of parliament will be considered by the council before a decision is made

we are now starting to discuss the future of the common agricultural policy after and to review the financial perspective
i should like to ask you about the communitys resources the budget that so many people say will not suffice for enlargement and how it was possible for you not to say a word about institutional approaches to combating fraud throughout the community fraud that amounts to billions of ecu and which would help to finance enlargement and our own internal economic policy instead
the british government promised a referendum on this treaty yet now it is pretending that it is somehow different
